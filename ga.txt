PROJECT SUMMARY
Project summary
Grant Preparation (General Information screen) — Provide an overall description of your project (including context and overall
objectives, planned activities and main achievements, and expected results and impacts (on target groups, change procedures,
capacities, innovation etc)). This summary should give readers a clear idea of what your project is about.
Use the project summary from your proposal.
SPecialised Education programmes in CybersecuriTy and Robotics (SPECTRO) will focus on the design and delivery
of two double-degree master’s programmes (ISCED Level 7, 120 ECTS) in two key digital technology areas for the
future of Europe: 1) Cybersecurity and 2) Robotics. The two specialised master’s programmes, which will also include
a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, will be designed and delivered by a consortium consisting of 12 higher
education institutions from 7 different countries, 2 innovative SMEs, 1 leading research centre in Information Systems
and EIT Digital, a pan-European organisation with in-depth knowledge and experience in the digital skills domain. The
master’s programmes developed by SPECTRO partners will address the labour market needs, foster strong interactions
and mobility between academia and business, strengthen knowledge triangle integration, promote entrepreneurship, and
considerably boost the growth of the existing EIT Digital ecosystem, one of the largest digital ecosystems in Europe.
In addition to the two master’s programme, SPECTRO partners will also develop and deploy a series of self-standing
learning modules on topics related to Cybersecurity and Robotics. These modules will lead to four different certifications,
which will be released by participating higher education institutions and EIT Digital. Dedicated marketing, promotion,
communication, and dissemination activities will be carried out by SPECTRO partners to maximise the outreach of
project activities and to attract the desired target audience to the master’s programmes and self-standing modules.
SPECTRO will expand the specialised education offer in Europe and will contribute to reducing the current shortage of
digital specialists in Europe, by providing training to more than 1000 European citizens in Cybersecurity and Robotics.

Objectives
• To design excellent education programmes addressing Europe’s skill needs in Cybersecurity, involving academia,
research, and innovative businesses.
• To deliver a master’s programme in Cybersecurity in Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and Romania.
• To deliver self-standing learning modules on Cybersecurity across the whole Europe, including modules on Innovation
and Entrepreneurship and Ethics.
Description
T1.1 Master's programme in Cybersecurity
Lead: ELTE. Duration: M1-M48.
The goal of this task is to design and deliver a master’s programmes in Cybersecurity in Europe, particularly in Finland,
France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania. The courses
will be delivered by 7 universities (ELTE, UNITN, UT, UR1, UTU, EURECOM, UBB) in collaboration with a research
centre (IRISA), and several innovative SMEs and businesses. Among SMEs, CYSCALE will play a major role, but many
other SMEs and corporates will be involved in the delivery of the master’s programme thanks to a series of dedicated
activities to
encourage the participation of business actors. The Master’s programme will cover the theoretical and practical aspects
of Cybersecurity, also addressing the needs of specific
sectors. To meet SO1, sector-specific skills and needs will be addressed through a set of different specialisations. Some
of the specialisations will also have focus on the ethical applications of digital technologies. The master’s programme
will include an integrated minor specialy in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Business challenges provided by SMEs
and companies will be used in some of the teaching activities. Lectures and mentors from CYSCALE and other SMEs
will contribute to teaching in classes and to the activities related to the I&E minor specialy. This task will lead to the
development of a dynamic digital ecosystem where academia, research, and industry work together to attract the best
talent worldwide and training specialists and future leaders in the field of Cybersecurity. This task will contribute to the
achievement of SO1, SO2, SO3 and KPI1, KPI3, KP8, KP11, KP17-21.
The task will be deployed in two steps:
1) Design the master’s programme based on labour market needs – M1-M12
This step aims to analyse the existing literature linked to the needs of the European labour market in digital skills and
in Cybersecurity. The labour market needs analysis will involve
the following steps:
1.1 Define a clear set of objectives with an explicit, reproducible methodology – M1,
1.2. Identify and research the most relevant studies that are in line with the objectives and define a tentative curriculum
for the master programme at each partner university– M2-M4,
1.3. Cross-check the findings of each partners’ studies and share knowledge and insights – M5
1.4. Adjust the tentative master’s programme curriculum based on the identified labour market needs – M6-M10,
1.5. Conclude the study via a systematic reporting and synthesis of the characteristics and findings and by finalising the
curriculum of the master’s programme at the 7 higher
education institutions involved – M11-M12.
All relevant studies will be collected in a single-entry point, the SPECTRO data repository, accessible by all project
partners. This step aims to build on the existing knowledge
and previous digital skills mapping activities run by all partners. ELTE will lead the task, but the other partners will be
equally involved, including not only the higher education institutions, but also EITD, CYSCALE and IRISA.
2) Deliver the master’s programme for two cycles – M13-M48
This step aims to deliver two full cycles of the master’s programme in Cybersecurity. The full cycles will last for two
academic years, with each academic year starting in September/October and ending in June/July (exact dates will depend
on the calendars of each higher education institution, which differ from country to country). A mandatory condition of
7

Project: 101123118 — SPECTRO — DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03
the master’s programme is that students enrolled to the programmes will need to study each academic year in a different
university from a different European country. The first year will be spent at the so-called Entry University and the second
at the so-called Exit University, offering a unique specialisation to students. The tentative list of specialisations is the
following, but it will be revised after the market analysis done in M1-M12:
- System Security (UNITN)
- Big Data Security (EURECOM)
- Software Security (UBB)
- High Tech, Human Touch in Cybersecurity (UT)
- Security of Networked Systems (UTU)
- Quantum, Post-Quantum, and Advanced Cryptography (ELTE)
In between the first and second year of studies, students will attend a summer course (very likely organised by a third
different higher education institution). EITD will coordinate the allocation of all SPECTRO students to the EITD summer
courses organised across Europe. The two cycles will be delivered as follows:
i) First cycle – M13-M34,
ii) Second cycle – M25-M36.
Students completing the full cycle, including completion of all courses, completion of an internship, and defence of the
master’s thesis will get a double degree from the two higher education institutions where they studied (Entry University
and Exit University) and an EIT Label certificate, pending successful certification of the master’s programme with the
EIT.
T1.2 Selfstanding modules on Cybersecurity
Lead: UTU. Duration: M1-M48.
Within this task, SPECTRO partners will design and deliver a set of self-standing modules on Cybersecurity. As part of
the modules, there will also be dedicated sections to 1) Innovation and Entrepreneurship and 2) Ethics in the application
of digital technologies, especially Cybersecurity. In line with SO21, the
modules will be developed to address as best as possible the needs of the European labour market, especially concerning
professional in needs of upskilling and reskilling. These needs
will be identified in the first months, thanks to a market analysis. The modules will be made available for free on a
single platform developed by SPECTRO and managed by EITD, to which all partners will have access. Some of the self-
standing modules might be also included as part of the courses included in the master’s programmes in Cybersecurity
(Task 1.1). As Task 1.1, Task 1.2 will be deployed in three steps:
1) Design the self-standing modules and related certification schemes based on market needs – M1-M16:
This step aims to analyse the existing literature linked to the needs of the European labour market in digital skills and
in Cybersecurity, with a specific focus on professionals who
need upskilling and re-skilling. The labour market needs analysis will be carried out in parallel to the analysis done
in Task 1.1, avoiding overlapping and with opportunities for knowledge sharing. The analysis will also be focused on
understanding the most appropriate type of certification scheme required by the market. This step will involve:
1.1. Define a clear set of objectives for the analysis of the labour market needs and certification needs with an explicit,
reproducible methodology – M1,
1.2. Identify and research the most relevant studies that are in line with the objectives – M2-M4,
1.3. Cross-check the findings of each partners’ studies and share knowledge and insights – M5
1.4. Define the self-learning programme curriculum based on the identified labour market needs – M6,
1.5. Define the certification schemes – M7-M16.
This task will be led by UTU, but the other partners will be involved and provide information and studies to reach the
objective of the market analysis, including not only the higher
education institutions, but also EITD, CYSCALE and IRISA. A significant contribution in the design of the certification
schemes will be offered by UT and EITD, both having experience on this topic through the certification schemes
in Cybersecurity defined in CONCORDIA project. The certification scheme will involve completion of 1) a set of
different modules, and 2) theoretical and practical exams. These exams will be hosted on a third-party platform, with
dedicated subcontracting budget allocated to EITD. SPECTRO partners envisage to develop two certification schemes
in Cybersecurity (see Section 2.2).
2) Development of the self-standing online modules – M7-M16:
The full curriculum of self-standing modules will be defined at M6, based on the already existing tentative list of
modules, and based on the results of the market needs analysis. After the definition of the curriculum this step will
involve the development of the self-standing learning modules. The design, development, and delivery of each single
module will be coordinated by one of the higher education institutions. The partner coordinating a module will use the
8

Project: 101123118 — SPECTRO — DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03
support of other partners in the consortium on several occasions. This support will be provided not only by the higher
education institutions, but also by IRISA, EITD, CYSCALE and other SMEs with expertise in Cybersecurity. In total,
SPECTRO will deliver at least 12 selfstanding modules as part of this task, 8 on Cybersecurity and 4 on Innovation and
Entrepreneurship or Ethics, contributing to KPI5, KPI6. The tentative list of modules is provided below. It includes a
module on Organisational Security as suggested in the call text. The list of modules is only a tentative list to show the
capacity and original ideas of each partner. It will be revised and updated based on the results of the labour market needs
and certification needs analysis.
Entry Level modules
- Introduction to Computer and Network Security by UNITN
- Organisational System Security by UTU
- Introduction to Access Control by UR1 with IRISA
- Introduction to Binary Analysis by UR1
Advanced modules
- Offensive Security by UT
- System and Application Security by UTU
- Advanced Cryptography by ELTE
- Quantum Cryptography by UBB
Modules on I&E and Ethics
- Digital Economy Principles by UBB
- Innovation Management by UBB with CYSCALE
- Business Development by UNITN
- Computer Ethics and Integrity by UBB
Although developed by different organisations, all modules will be developed and delivered following common
principles.
Harmonisation of the curricula and formats will be ensured within this task, and by the overarching activities of Task 4.2.
3) Delivery of the self-standing online modules – M17-M48:
The self-standing learning modules will be delivered via a single platform (when in online form), which will also include
the registration portal to all modules. The modules will involve 1) an asynchronous part in online format that participants
can follow at their own pace, including online lectures, exercises, and business challenges, and 2) in most cases, live
classes, which will serve for participants to interact with the lecturers involved in the asynchronous part of the modules.
Live classes will be mostly held in online format. The portal and enrolment process will be coordinated by EITD, but all
SPECTRO partners will have access and visibility to the enrolment portal. To apply to a selfstanding module, participants
will need to register to the portal. Registration will be simple. Once the registration is approved, it will allow application
to all modules developed by SPECTRO
partners. Applications to the modules including only asynchronous content and without live classes will be available
any time, while applications to the modules including live classes
will be available at specific time windows. The schedule of live classes will be aligned with the academic semester
(according to the timeline defined in Section 2.2). Delivery of the modules will start at M17, with each module being
delivered for at least two cycles. Modules available in fully online mode will be available to be completed for many
more cycles. Specific windows of duration of one month (in January and in May of each year) will be available for
participants who successfully completed the required online modules to take certification exams. During the one-month
window multiple dates will be made available to take the certification exams. Only participants who have completed
the self-standing modules required by a certification scheme will be admitted to the certification exams. Participants can
complete the self-standing modules required by each certification across several periods.

Description
T2.1 Master's programme in Autonomous Systems and Intelligent Robots
Lead: UNITN. Duration: M1-M48.
The goal of this task is to design and deliver a master’s programmes in Robotics in Europe, particularly in Finland,
France, Hungary, Italy, Sweden. The courses will be delivered by eight universities (ELTE, BME, UNITN, AALTO,
KTH, UNIBO, UCA, EURECOM) in collaboration with one research centre (IRISA), and several innovative SMEs and
businesses. Among SMEs, a series of companies already engaged in research activities with the SPECTRO partners
will play a major role collaborating very closely in the curriculum definition. Many other SMEs and corporates will be
involved in the delivery of the master’s programme thanks to a series of dedicated activities to encourage the participation
of business actors (including a business internship programme promoted across all Europe by EITD and SPECTRO
partners).
The Master’s programme will cover both theoretical and practical aspects of Robotics, also addressing the needs of
specific sectors. Application of Artificial Intelligence in Robotics will be tackled in the programme. Sector-specific
skills and needs will be addressed through a set of different specialisations offered in the second year of the programme.
Each university participating to the second year will offer a different specialisation, contributing to the achievement of
SO1. The master’s programme will include a minor speciality in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Business challenges
provided by SMEs will be used in the teaching activities. Lectures and mentors from SMEs will contribute to teaching
in classes and to the activities related to the I&E minor speciality.
Task 1.1 will lead to developing a dynamic digital ecosystem where academia, research and companies work together
to provide attract the best talent worldwide and training specialists in the field of Robotics. These specialists will also
be aware of the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems. The task will be deployed in
two steps:
1) Design the master’s programme based on labour market needs – M1-M12
This step aims to analyse the existing literature linked to the needs of the European labour market in digital skills and
in the broad field of Robotics, including its integration with AI and the related ethical aspects. The labour market needs
analysis will involve the same steps mentioned in Task 1.1 (see WP1 description), as the tasks will be carried out in
parallel. This step task will be led by UNITN, involving all other partners in this task, including also EITD, GIM and
IRISA besides the higher education institutions.
2) Deliver the master’s programme for two full cycles – M13-M48
This step aims to deliver two full cycles of the master’s programme. The full cycles will last for two academic years, with
each academic year starting in September/October and ending in June/July (exact dates will depend on the calendars of
each higher education institution, which differ from country to country). The first year will be spent at the so-called Entry
University and the second at the Exit University, offering a unique specialisation to students. The list of specialisations
will be finalised after the market analysis done in M1-M12, but a tentative list is the following:
- Smart Industry and Smart Mobility Systems at UNIBO
- Intelligent Robots at AALTO
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Robotics at ELTE
- Intelligent Software for Autonomous Systems at KTH
- Sensing Big Data for Intelligent Robots at EURECOM
- Autonomous Robotic Systems with AI at BME
- Healthcare Smart Autonomous Systems at UNITN
In between the first and second year of studies, students will attend a summer programme (very likely organised by a
third different higher education institution).EITD will coordinate the allocation of all SPECTRO students to the EITD
summer programmes organised across Europe. Two full cycles of the master’s will be delivered:
1) First cycle – M13-M34,
2) Second cycle – M25-M36.
Students completing the full cycle, including completion of all courses, completion of an internship, and defence of the
master’s thesis will get a double degree from the two higher education institutions where they studied (Entry University
and Exit University) and an EIT Label certificate, pending successful certification of the programme with the EIT.
T2.2 Self-standing modules on Robotics
Lead: UNIBO. Duration: M1-M48.
Within this task, SPECTRO partners will design and deliver a set of self-standing modules on Robotics. As part of the
10

Project: 101123118 — SPECTRO — DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03
modules, there will also be dedicated sections to 1) Innovation and Entrepreneurship and 2) Ethics in the application of
digital technologies, especially Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.
The modules will be developed to address the needs of the European labour market. The target audience will include
professionals in needs of upskilling and reskilling. Their needs will be identified through research and market analysis
activities.
The modules will be made available for free. Some of the self-standing modules might be also included as part of the
courses included in the master’s programmes in Autonomous Systems and Intelligent Robots (Task 2.1). This will offer
the possibility to higher education institutions to include as part of their own curricula some teaching content from
another higher education institutions, increasing the diversity and attractiveness of the courses offered within SPECTRO
master’s programmes. As Task 1.1, Task 1.2 will be deployed in two steps:
1) Design the curriculum of self-standing modules and its related certification schemes based on market needs– M1-
M16:
To achieve SO1, this step aims to analyse the existing literature linked to the needs of the labour market in Europe, with
a specific focus on professionals who need upskilling and re-skilling. The labour market needs analysis will be carried
out in parallel to the analysis done in Task 1.1, avoiding overlapping and with opportunities for knowledge sharing. The
analysis will also focus on understanding the type of certifications required by the market. This step will involve:
1.1) Define a clear set of objectives for the analysis of the labour market needs and certification needs with an explicit,
reproducible methodology – M1,
1.2) Identify and research the most relevant studies that are in line with the objectives – M2-M4,
1.3) Cross-check the findings of each partners’ studies and share knowledge and insights – M5
1.4) Define the self-learning programme curriculum based on the identified labour market needs – M6,
1.5) Define the certification schemes – M7-M16.
UNIBO will lead the whole process, but all the other partners part of this task will be involved and provide relevant
inputs, including also EITD and IRISA. The certifications will be developed in parallel to Task 1.2, following similar
schemes. SPECTRO partners envisage to develop two certifications in the field of Robotics (see Section 2.2).
2) Development of the self-standing online modules – M7-M16:
The full list of learning modules will be defined at M6, based on the already existing tentative list of modules, and based
on the results of the needs analysis. After the definition of the curriculum this step will involve the development of
the self-standing learning modules. The design, development, and delivery of each single module will be coordinated
by a higher education institution. The partner coordinating a module will use the support of other partners in several
moments of the development phase. This support will be provided not only by the higher education institutions, but
also by IRISA, EITDand the SMEs with expertise in Robotics, with whom the partners of the consortium will enforce
existing collaborations or establish new ones. SPECTRO will deliver at least 13 self-standing modules (contributing to
KPI5). The tentative list of these modules is provided below. The list below will be revised and updated based on the
results of the labour market needs and certification needs analysis. In the certification schemes, the modules on Robotics
will be complemented by modules on I&E and Ethics which will be shared with Task 1.2.
Entry Level modules
- Introduction to Robotics (UNITN)
- Introduction to Industrial Automation (BME)
- Introduction to Software Engineering (KTH)
- Introduction to Computer Vision (BME)
- Principles of Artificial Intelligence (ELTE)
Advanced modules
- Diagnosis and Control (UNIBO)
- Embedded Systems for Robotics (AALTO with GIM)
- Distributed Systems for Robotics (KTH)
- Robotic Manipulation (AALTO)
- Artificial Intelligence for Intelligent Robots (ELTE)
- Distributed Autonomous Systems (UNIBO)
- Robots for Healthcare (UNITN)
- Mobile Systems for Industrial Applications (UNITN)
Modules on I&E and Ethics
- Shared with Cybersecurity (see Task 1.2)
Although developed by different organisations, all modules will be developed and delivered following common
principles. Harmonisation of the curricula and formats of the modules will be done within this task, and within Task
4.2 at project level.
3) Delivery of the self-standing online modules – M17-M48:
The portal and enrolment process will be coordinated by EITD. Registration procedure and delivery timeline will be the
same of the modules on Cybersecurity in Task 1.2 (see Task 1.2 description and Section 2.2 for further details).

T4.3 Enrolment and scholarship programme administration
Lead: EITD. Duration: M3-M48.
The goal of this task is to manage the enrolment process to SPECTRO education programmes, ensuring an efficient
enrolment process to the SPECTRO master’s programmes and self-standing modules and a fair allocation of scholarships
(in line with SO4). The task will be led by EITD, but all higher education institutions will be involved in the enrolment
process and allocation of scholarships.
Enrolment to the master’s programmes
Enrolment to the two master’s programmes will be done via a single enrolment portal, which will be made created and
managed by EITD. All Local Programme Coordinators will have visibility on open applications. When enrolling to one
of the two master’s programmes, applicants can select 3 options as Entry University and 3 options as Exit University
with order of priority. To apply to the master’s programmes, participants will be required to upload a series of documents
into the application portal. Section 2.2 details the documents required in the application as well as, the full list of steps
leading to the acceptance of a student. The allocation of scholarships will be done at the end of the review process.
Students awarded with a scholarship will be informed in the acceptance letter. The scholarship programme will be based
on merit and will promote diversity, offering different type of financial support (see Section 2.2 for more details).
Enrolment to self-standing learning modules
The enrolment to the self-standing learning modules will be done via a single enrolment portal. To apply to a self-
standing module, participants will need to register to the portal. Registration will be simple, requiring only a limited
number of basic details to participants and a proof of identification. Registrations will be reviewed on a rolling basis by
the platform manager appointed by EITD. After registration approval, participants can apply to all modules developed
by SPECTRO partners.
T4.4 Community, partnership, and mobility management

activities carried out within other tasks of the project, involving interactions, and building of partnerships.
Development of an exchange scheme for guest lecturers (M4-M12)
All SPECTRO partners, including the SMEs and research centre, will form a pool of guest lectures in online format
or face-to-face format. In this latter case, the guest lecturers will be available to travel at the premises of a SPECTRO
partners to offer (series of) lectures on a topic of expertise.
Development of an exchange scheme for business mentors (M4-M12)
In a similar way to the exchange of guest lectures, a pool of business mentors will be created for mentoring activities
in the I&E minor of the two master’s programmes. The business mentors will include representative of the SMEs and
IRISA and staff from the higher education institutions, mainly representatives from the staff involved in the teaching
of the I&E minor in the master’s programmes.
The mobility of guest lectures and business mentors will be implemented between M13 and M48 and will be
administrated via this task. Each SPECTRO partner has a budget reservation for travel under this task.
Development of an internship scheme for students (M4-M8-M18)
SPECTRO partners will define a scheme to collect internship opportunities from corporates and SMEs across Europe,
leveraging on the local networks of every SPECTRO partner. CYSCALE and GIM will help in defining a programme
that is suitable for SMEs. The internship programme will be built on the existing EIT Digital Internship Programme
and will facilitate for students to find relevant internship opportunities. The internship will be mandatory for all students
during the second year of studies. The first internship will take place from M25 onwards (for students enrolled to the first
full cycle of the master’s programmes), with registration opening in M19. The internship programme will contribute to
define effective collaboration and integration between SPECTRO partners and a wide group of business stakeholders.
T4.5 Data management, ethical and legal issues
Lead: EITD. Duration: M1-M48.
This task will include the development of a Data Management Plan (DMP) as a distinct milestone within the first 3
months of the project. Evolving over the lifetime of the project, it will present the status of the project's reflections
and learning on data management. The DMP will follow the FAIR guidelines for open research data. It will provide an
14

Project: 101123118 — SPECTRO — DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03
analysis of the main elements of the data management policy for all the datasets that will be collected and generated
by the SPECTRO project.
This task will develop the data protection and security (DP&S) framework where the guiding principles and the main
procedures regarding legal issues, privacy, and data protection, including compliance with the GDPR, will be addressed.
The DP&S framework will be crucial to define the procedures to handle the data related to external to the project
individuals such as the participants to the survey and to the workshops part of WP1, and to the course participants
subjects of WP2.
Additionally, this task will address the ethical and societal challenges that may arise from execution of the project. DMP
will contain all activities in the project that will be continuously examined from the viewpoint of ethical and regulatory
issues. Corrective actions will be taken as soon as there is a risk of unethical behaviour or if activities in the project do
not fit the regulatory requirements.

Risk
number
Description
Work Package
No(s)
Proposed Mitigation Measures
1
Key deliverables, milestones delayed due to
disagreement on scope or purpose. Likelihood: Low.
WP1, WP2, WP4,
WP3
The Description of Actions to be performed is drafted in the clearest way in the Grant
Agreement. In case of disagreement, a conflict resolution process is initiated
2
Failure to recognise linkages between tasks, and
critical paths. Likelihood: Low.
WP1, WP2, WP4,
WP3
Regular online meetings within and between WPs are planned to ensure that linkages are
identified and strengthened.
3
To produce high-quality results, the consortium will
have to dedicate more efforts, corresponding to
higher budget. Likelihood: Low.
WP1, WP2, WP4,
WP3
Advanced monitoring mechanisms will be put in place by the Project Manager to track the
resources spent. All consortium partners are experienced in this field, being used to work
efficiently in organisations that have sufficient resources to predict the amount of work to
perform within the time limit of the project.
4
During the definition of the curricula of the master’s
programme, the courses offered by one of the
higher education institutions do not have learning
outcomes aligned with the courses offered by
another institution. Likelihood: Low.
WP1, WP2
A tentative curriculum of the courses offered in the master’s programmes by each partner
(see Section 4) has been defined at proposal stage to avoid this issue as much as possible.
Shall this issue arise during the finalisation of the curricula, a conflict resolution process will
be initiated by WP1/WP2 Leader with the support of the Project Coordinator if required.
5
The understanding process of the needs of the
labour markets does not provide enough significant
information to find an agreement on the target
audience of the self-learning modules. Likelihood:
Medium.
WP1, WP2
The approach to understand the labour market needs will integrate various methods (e.g.
surveys) and diverse sources to analyse relevant literature and gather data from the labour
market, also leveraging on the SMEs part of SPECTRO consortium and industry partners
in the EITD ecosystem. In case that one of the methods does not provide the required
information, they will complement with each other.
6
Lack of participation to some of the education
programmes 
in 
Cybersecurity 
or 
Robotics.
Likelihood: Medium.
WP1, WP2
Thanks to the preparation work carried out in the context of WP1 and WP2 to define
education curricula that are market-relevant, the education programmes will be very well
aligned with the needs of the labour market, especially the ones from the 7 SPECTRO focus
countries. Thanks to a generous scholarship programme, the education offer will be highly
relevant and attractive for European students. The self-standing modules will be offered for
free and adjusted in format to meet participants’ needs, thus they are expected to be very
attractive.
7
Key deliverables and milestones related to WP1, WP2
All higher education institutions in the consortium are available to adjust the course format

and have learnt a lot in the past couple of years during the COVID-19 pandemic. As an
extreme measure, in order to achieve the desired impact, the delivery of the some of the face-
to-face courses envisaged as part of the two master’s programmes will be done in online
format.
8
Marketing and promotion campaigns does not allow
to reach the target audience and generate new leads.
Likelihood: Medium.
WP3
A multi-channel marketing strategy will be put in place, involving coordinated promotion
activities from all partners, especially the business/professional associations. This strategy
will allow to understand which channels are most effective to reach the target audience. These
channels will be prioritised, while channels that will be underperforming over time will be
discontinued.
9
Lack of consensus in the definition of the
scholarship programmes. Likelihood: Low.
WP4
The scholarship programmes to target different people in needs and to promote diversity has
been already discussed by the Project Coordinator with the consortium during the preparation
of SPECTRO project proposal. Shall any issue arise during the duration of the project, an
clear decision-making system will be put in place since the early stage of the project to take
decisions.
10
Lack of consortium consensus in the approval of a
decision. Likelihood: Low.
WP4
An effective decision-making system will be put in place since the early stage of the project,
so that a clear process is available whenever a decision should be taken.

1. RELEVANCE 
1.1 
Objectives and activities 
Objectives and activities 
Excellence of EU education is crucial for resilient, secure, cutting-edge technologies 
The digital era is creating numerous new opportunities for the economy and society, but at the same time it 
introduces new challenges on which Europe should focus to develop a strong knowledge base for pushing the 
limits of technology while safeguarding the ethical aspects of the progress achieved. Resilient, secure, and 
trustworthy infrastructures and technologies are needed to ensure the respect of European rules and value during 
the twin transition to a green and digital Europe. 
Building on the Strategy on Shaping Europe's Digital Future, in March 2021 the European Commission presented 
a vision for Europe’s digital transformation by 2030. This vision revolves around four main pillars: 1) skills, 2) 
government, 3) infrastructure and 4) business, all areas being part of the Digital Compass. The Digital Compass 
is designed to translate the European Union’s digital ambitions for 2030 into concrete terms. The plan for digital 
transformation by 2030 is crucial to ensure the transition towards a climate-neutral, circular, and resilient 
economy. Furthermore, it highlights the EU's ambition to be digitally sovereign in an open and interconnected 
world and pursue digital policies that empower people and businesses to seize a human-centred, sustainable, 
and more prosperous digital future1. 
The Digital Compass sets a series of ambitious targets that Europe should achieve by 2030, including having 20 
million specialists in Information and Communications Technology employed in Europe by 2030. To achieve this 
target, the European Union needs digitally empowered citizens, a competent workforce, and significantly more 
digital specialists than today. This can only be achieved by the development of a high-quality, high-performing 
digital education ecosystem as well as by an effective policy to attract talent, which is one of the aims of the 
actions included in the Advanced Digital Skills pillar of the Digital Europe Programme. 
As part of the new EU’s long-term budget for 2021 to 2027 of €1.2 trillion, the Digital Europe Programme 
provides funding supporting projects in five key capacity areas: 1) Supercomputing, 2) Artificial Intelligence, 3) 
Cybersecurity, 4) Advanced Digital Skills, and 5) ensuring a wide use of digital technologies across the economy 
and society, including through Digital Innovation Hubs. As Europe sets off on its path to recovery, the shortage 
in qualified staff mastering digital skills is one of the main obstacles to new investment for businesses and 
represents a substantial barrier to both national and European competitiveness. When looking at the digital skills 
of the current workforce, only 65% has digital skills which are “above basic”. According to Eurostat, more than

50% of companies trying to recruit ICT specialists reported problems filling vacancies2. Significant barriers to 
filling vacancies included lack of relevant qualifications and lack of experience. In this context, the need of 
excellence of EU education in digital areas is of utmost importance, including the need of higher cooperation 
education and training institutions, research, and business. 
The European Union needs to build on the strength of its education and training institutions to improve its 
specialised education offer in the digital domain through the development of excellent education and training 
partnerships, gathering higher education institutions, research centres, and innovative businesses. This will 
allow Europe to improve its capacity to nurture and attract talents, and at the same time allow to create 
ecosystems that will drive digital innovation across the continent. 
Cybersecurity and Robotics infrastructure and technology are essential for Europe 
Digital technology and infrastructure have a critical role in the private lives of European citizens and in 
business environments. Every individual and business rely on them to communicate, work, advance science, 
and answer current environmental problems. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted not only 
how much it is important to rely on technology, but also how important is for Europe to be independent from 
systems and solutions coming from other regions of the world. 
Among the digital infrastructures and technologies that are critical for Europe, Cybersecurity and Robotics play 
a key role. Since the end of 2020, the European Union has defined an EU Cybersecurity Strategy to make 
physical and digital critical entities more resilient, identifying technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Encryptions, 
Quantum Computing, and future generation networks as essential for Europe’s Cybersecurity. The importance 
of Cybersecurity and Robotics for Europe is also noticeable from several other recent reports3,4,5 from the 
European Commission and relevant EU bodies, highlighting the significantly high impact that both Cybersecurity 
and Robotics can have on European economy and society. 
Cybersecurity has always been a never-ending race for both public bodies and private businesses. Nevertheless, 
the rate of change in Cybersecurity is continuously accelerating. Companies, which are continuing to invest 
in technology to run their businesses, are layering more and more systems into their networks to support remote 
work, enhance the customer experience, and generate value, all of which creates potential new vulnerabilities. 
At the same time, adversaries, which are no longer limited to single individual actors, include highly sophisticated 
organizations that leverage integrated tools and capabilities with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The 
scope of the threat is growing, and no organization is immune from cyber threats. The risk is coalescing 
around three critical areas: Endpoints and Cloud workloads, Identity, and Data6. Small and medium enterprises, 
municipalities, and state and federal governments face such risks along with large companies. Even today’s most 
sophisticated cyber controls, no matter how effective, will soon be obsolete. In this environment, Europe must be 
prepared for the accelerated digitisation expected in the next years. At present, Europe is set to suffer skills 
shortage. The unrealized output of EU countries due to talent deficits could total even more than 1 trillion EUR 
by 20307, with a high share of this deficit that could be in the Cybersecurity sector. 
In the field of Robotics, Europe is currently a world-class leader in the production of robots. For example, one out 
of four of industrial robots in the world are produced in Europe8. Robotics is a flagship sector in which Europe 
must keep its competitive advantage while guaranteeing technological sovereignty and remaining strictly 
compliant with European social and ethics values. The massive adoption of robotics technology should ensure 
that machines are developed to be robust, reliable, and dependable and that their design and development 
should comply with human rights values. A decisive, agile, horizontal, coordinated, and multidisciplinary public 
intervention is needed to maximise the benefits of Robotics, address its challenges, and minimize the negative

effects9. It is important to build methodologies to keep humans in command, for human-robot collaboration 
and for fusion of skills from human and robots. Robots and AI can support decision making, but the responsibility 
must stay with humans. Integration of latest software developments for Autonomous Systems to create intelligent 
Robotic Systems is fundamental. Companies and organisations in Europe need leaders and technical experts 
with a deep technical expertise in Robotics, who can lead the development of Autonomous Systems and 
Intelligent Robots. At the same time, these leaders and technical experts should also be able to think about 
what could go wrong when implementing, purchasing, or using Robotics technology, being always aware of the 
ethical aspects connected to the use of robots. 
SPECTRO - General objectives 
In the context described above, SPecialised Education programmes in CybersecuriTy and Robotics 
(SPECTRO) will improve the capacity of Europe to nurture and attract digital talents in crucial digital technology 
areas for Europe. SPECTRO will strengthen the degree of cooperation between higher education institutions and 
the private sector across Europe in the areas of Cybersecurity and Robotics through the development and 
delivery of master’s programmes and specialised online modules leading to certifications. As part of its education 
offer, SPECTRO will also include dedicated training activities in Innovation and Entrepreneurship to help 
participants drive innovation and digital breakthroughs in Europe as well as courses and self-standing modules 
focusing on the ethical principles for trustworthy technology application. 
The education programmes developed and delivered by SPECTRO partners will address the needs of the 
labour market and aim to provide participants with the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge to 
contribute to the design, deployment, and use of the current and future generation digital technologies in key 
domains for Europe such as Cybersecurity and Robotics. SPECTRO is expected to contribute to expanding the 
education offer across Europe and increasing the number of students specialised in key digital 
technologies, in line with the general objectives, themes and priorities of the Call DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03- 
SPECIALISED-EDU - Specialised education programmes or modules in key capacity areas. 
SPECTRO aims to develop excellent education and training partnerships, gathering academia, research 
centres and innovative business to design and deliver two master’s programmes, one in Cybersecurity and 
one in Robotics. Both Master’s programme will be double-degree programmes (ISCED Level 7, 120 ECTS) with 
a minor specialty in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E). This minor specialty will consist of 30 ECTS in 
total, including a summer course, compulsory to all Masters’ students, in between the first and second year of 
studies. Mobility between higher education institutions and business partners will be a key ingredient of the 
master’s programmes. Students enrolled to the master’s programmes will be required to study in 2 different 
higher education institutions from 2 different countries as well as to attend a mandatory business internship. 
As further detailed in the next sections, each programme will also offer a set of different technical specialisations 
through dedicated curricula in the second year of the programmes. 
SPECTRO partners will also design and develop a set of self-standing modules on topics related the two 
master’s programmes. These modules will be delivered either in online or in-person format (further explanations 
in Section 2.1) and will lead to certifications, which will be released by the higher education institutions 
participating to the modules and EIT Digital, one of the Knowledge and Innovation Communities of the European 
Institute of Innovation and Technology. Different types of certifications will be offered, as further explained in 
Section 2.1, in order to meet the requirements of different target groups (e.g. young professionals without a 
degree in Computer Science vs experienced professionals looking for upskilling). 
The SPECTRO project will have a duration of four years (48 months) during which the master’s programmes and 
self-standing modules/courses will be delivered for two full cycles, in line with the requirements of the Call 
DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03-SPECIALISED-EDU. 
The general objectives of SPECTRO can be summarised as follows: 
• 
To support the development of advanced digital skills in Europe, with a special focus on two key digital 
technology domains for Europe: Cybersecurity and Robotics. 
• 
To support the development of a digitalised European economy and society that is anchored in the 
empowerment of citizens and businesses, ensuring the security of Europe’s digital supply chains. 
• 
To improve the education offer in Europe, through the design and delivery of new specialised Master’s 
Programmes and related self-standing learning modules leading to certifications. 
• 
To support students from EU and associated countries in getting access to excellent education, ensuring 
diversity in terms of gender, age, social and economic background. 
• 
To create a sustainable digital ecosystem in Europe based on strong connections and sustainable 
partnerships between higher education institutions and the private sector. 
To operationalise these general objectives, SPECTRO will focus on four specific objectives. As explained

SPECTRO – Main activities 
The implementation of SPECTRO activities will be led by a consortium of 15 partners (16 applicants), including: 
• 
12 degree-awarding higher education institutions from 7 different countries, 
• 
2 SMEs from 2 different countries, 
• 
1 research centre (applying under the same legal entity of one of the higher education institutions), 

 
7  
• 
1 pan-European organisation driving digital transformation and digital skills training in Europe. 
The consortium will be led by this latter pan-European organisation, which is EIT Digital. EIT Digital is an 
organisation co-funded by the European Union and with more than ten years of experience in the design and 
delivery of education programmes across Europe in most relevant key digital technology areas, including Artificial 
Intelligence, Data, Cybersecurity, Blockchain, Robotics, and Internet of Things. 
In line with SO4, SPECTRO activities will target the whole Europe, aiming to train students from all EU and 
associated countries. The programmes will also be open to non-EU students, but no financial support or 
dedicated scholarship programmes will be provided to non-EU students. The focus on European level will be 
ensured by the higher education institutions in the SPECTRO consortium, which will be from 7 different EU 
countries: Finland, France, Italy, Hungary, Netherlands, Romania, Sweden. We believe the selection of these 7 
EU countries is relevant from several perspectives, including: 
• 
Geographical - they represent countries from different European regions (North, South, West, East), 
• 
Maturity of the ecosystem - they are positioned in various parts of the spectrum Digital Economy and 
Society Index10 (Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands are at the top end of the spectrum, Hungary and 
Romania are at the bottom two end, while Italy and France in the central part of the spectrum, almost in 
symmetrical positions with respect to the EU average) 
• 
Integration of digital technologies – the indicator11 more specifically linked to the usage of digital 
technologies for business clearly highlights the difference between these countries, which will be able to 
exchange best practices in SPECTRO activities. 
SPECTRO activities and education programmes will focus on two key technological areas that are strategic for 
Europe: 1) Cybersecurity and 2) Robotics. A particular focus will be also paid on providing training, on Innovation 
and Entrepreneurship and Ethical Principles for Trustworthy Technology (e.g. self-standing modules on 
Organisational Security, Computer Ethics, see Task 1.2). The project activities will revolve around the 
development and delivery of education programmes in Cybersecurity and Robotics, namely: 
• 
2 Master’s programmes, one in Cybersecurity and one in Robotics. Both Master’s programme will last 
two years, will be double-degree programmes (ISCED Level 7, 120 ECTS) and will offer students a minor 
specialty in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E) for a total of 30 ECTS. This I&E minor specialty will 
include a summer course, compulsory for all students, scheduled in between the end of Master’s Entry 
year and the beginning of the Exit year. The summer course will focus on turning innovative digital 
technologies into business. 
• 
At least 25 self-standing learning modules on topics related to Cybersecurity and Robotics, including 
dedicate sections on Innovation and Entrepreneurship and Ethics for Trustworthy Technology. These 
modules will be available for free and will target a much broader audience than the master’s programme. 
The modules will lead to certifications. Participants will be able to follow the modules according to 
different paths, leading to 4 different certifications. 
All higher education activities delivered by SPECTRO partners will be facilitated by trainers and practitioners with 
recognized expertise in Cybersecurity and Robotics, stemming from universities, research centres, and 
SMEs. Their diverse expertise and experience will be leveraged throughout the project and, most importantly, 
during the development phase of the SPECTRO education offer. Workshops will be organized to facilitate 
knowledge exchange between the higher education institutions and other partners in the consortium to structure 
the optimal education content using the best tools available for reaching the learning objectives. 
In addition to the master’s programme, the consortium will design, develop and deliver modules – that can be 
combined in short-term training programmes – that will facilitate the training of students from other Master’s 
programmes across Europe and also help reskilling and upskilling of European workforce. These modules 
will be delivered in different formats, including asynchronous online mode and blended mode (involving 
asynchronous online training sessions combined with face-to-face classes). The format will be chosen based 
on the target audience and their identified needs, as further explained in Section 2.1, allowing flexibility for 
participants who in parallel, need to continue working. 
In the development of the self-standing modules, SPECTRO will leverage the expertise of EIT Digital and 
University of Twente under the CONCORDIA project12 as well as on the expertise of University of Trento in

CyberSec4Europe project13, where UNITN led the activities related to the design of a reference curriculum 
for Cybersecurity. In designing its MSc programme in Cybersecurity, SPECTRO will consider such curriculum, 
plus it will take in account the CyberSec4Europe’s review of European MSc programmes in cybersecurity. 
CONCORDIA is an EU-funded project in which a methodology for designing and deploying online courses was 
developed and successfully piloted14 together with a detailed scheme for offering certifications in the field of 
Cybersecurity. This scheme will be taken as a reference by SPECTRO partners to develop certifications for the 
self-standing modules, as foreseen by the Call DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03-SPECIALISED-EDU. 
Certifications in both Cybersecurity and Robotics will be developed for the self-standing modules. SPECTRO will 
offer education programmes in three different formats: in-presence, online, hybrid. In line with the requirements 
of the Call DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03-SPECIALISED-EDU, the programmes will address the labour market 
needs and will contribute to train specialists in Cybersecurity and Robotics who are acknowledgeable about 
the use of advanced digital technologies in specific sectors. In particular: 
• 
The two master’s programmes will be designed and delivered to cover both the theoretical and 
practical aspects of Cybersecurity and Robotics, using a combination of face-to-face workshops, group 
activities, and hands-on exercises to cover everything from the basics of Cybersecurity and Robotics to 
more specific skills, also addressing the needs of specific sectors (e.g. Post-Quantum Cybersecurity, 
applications of Intelligent Robots in Healthcare, Robotics for Smart Mobility). Sector-specific skills and 
needs will be addressed through a set of different specialisations offered in the second year of the 
master’s programme. As detailed in Section 2.2 and in the WP2 description in Section 4, each university 
participating to the second year of the master’s programmes will offer a different specialisation. This will 
allow to widen the education offer of SPECTRO programmes and offer students the opportunity to 
become specialists in their desired field. Some of the specialisations will also have focus on the 
ethical applications of digital technologies (e.g. Cybersecurity with a “human touch”). Thanks to an 
integrated minor specialty in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (further details provided in Section 2.2), 
the master’s programmes will also allow participants to acquire advanced digital skills and 
competences related to digital technologies and how they can be deployed to innovate and expand 
businesses. Business challenges provided by SMEs will be used in some of the teaching activities. 
Additionally, completion of an internship will be a mandatory component of the master’s programmes, 
as explained in Section 2.2. Building on the already existing EIT Digital Internship Programme15, 
SPECTRO partners will put in place a system for students to find relevant internship opportunities in their 
country or abroad. 
• 
The learning modules on Cybersecurity and Robotics for Master’ students, working professionals or job 
seekers will provide participants the possibility to i) acquire general digital skills and competences 
(e.g. Web and Internet Security, Digital Innovation Management), ii) acquire advanced skills and 
competences related to specific aspects of digital technologies that can be highly relevant to their job 
role (e.g. Distributed Autonomous Systems) or iii) complement other education programmes in which 
they are currently enrolled or they just recently completed (e.g. another master’s programme in Computer 
Science) with a set of advanced digital skills that was is lacking in their past/present education curriculum. 
The modules will be often practical and reflect the latest developments in Cybersecurity and Robotics. 
The inclusion of the most recent development and state-of-the-art technologies will be ensured through 
a systematic literature and market review at the start of the project. All partners, not only the higher 
education institutions, will be involved in this review process. SPECTRO partners will be able to 
exchange their knowledge through brainstorming and alignment sessions to be held regularly in the first 
months of the projects. Additionally, we envisage to validate or further expand our findings by consulting 
the relevant stakeholders via a dedicated survey. All self-standing modules will be made available for 
free during the duration of the project, being accessible to people with limited financial capacity from all 
over Europe. 
It is important to mention part of education programmes, in relation to the master’s programmes, will be built on 
the existing contents developed by SPECTRO partners in the framework of the EIT Digital Master School16. In 
this case, this project will support the learning content review and considerable improvements of the curricula 
to align with the all the new specialisations that will be developed specifically for SPECTRO project. In addition, 
in comparison with the traditional EIT Digital and other master’s programmes on the market, the master’s

programmes developed within SPECTRO will involve a considerably higher degree of collaboration with 
business and research, with a significant participation of these actors in the teaching and internship 
programmes. As for the curriculum, content, and certifications in relation to the self-standing modules, this will 
be developed from scratch by the consortium partners in the SPECTRO project. 
Building on existing content and already existing partnerships and connection among partners will ensure a 
smooth start of the project and facilitate the implementation of SPECTRO activities. The goal is to develop 
master’s programmes and learning modules leading to certifications that are highly relevant and attractive for 
students in the EU, but also for working professionals looking for up-skilling or re-skilling in the case of the 
learning modules. All previously existing content from each partner in connection to the master’s programmes 
will be reviewed in the first phase of the project, and improved wherever needed, to ensure that SPECTRO 
education programmes are attractive, relevant, and addressing the current needs of the labour market. 
A quality assurance mechanism will be put in place by the consortium to ensure that the programmes and 
modules offered remain relevant and up to date throughout the duration of the SPECTRO project. For example, 
following the execution of each course included in the master’s programme, the project partners will carry out 
satisfaction surveys among students on the teaching and learning methods to further adjust and improve the 
subsequent course editions. 
The SPECTRO consortium will ensure the education programmes offered by the project are well promoted from 
the project start and throughout its duration, leveraging the channels and connection opportunities made 
available by the large network of partners in SPECTRO consortium, including the network of more than 300 
partners made available by the pan-European organisation coordinating the project. Whenever appropriate, the 
consortium will also connect with relevant Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH) and other running EU projects, 
especially from the Digital Europe Programme and Erasmus+ programme. The SPECTRO consortium partners 
are involved in more than 10 EDIH projects starting in late 2022 or early 2023 (e.g. Robocoast, FAIR, DigitalTech, 
Health Data Sweden, EDIH Zuid Netherlands, Digitaliza Madrid). The project partners are also involved in several 
other relevant projects funded under the Horizon Europe, Erasmus+ or Digital Europe Programme, as further 
proved by the list of projects attached to this proposal. 
Additional promotion of the education programmes will be achieved by listing the programmes on the Digital 
Skills and Jobs Platform17 and other topic-related relevant platforms (e.g. REWIRE project CyberABILITY 
platform18 for Cybersecurity related courses and alike). The education programmes developed by SPECTRO 
partners will also be included and advertised as part of the EIT Digital portfolio of education programmes. To 
maximize the attractiveness of the training programs, a range of specific actions will be proposed as part of the 
marketing and promotion plan (see Section 4, WP3 description). These actions will involve the design and 
deployment of specific marketing campaigns, also including paid social-media campaigns, to reach the target 
audience across whole Europe. Online and face-to-face promotion and recruitment events at each higher 
education institutions in the consortium as well as presence at relevant events, conferences and job fairs will be 
carried out to increase the visibility of the education programmes and maximise the number of applications to 
SPECTRO education programmes. 
SPECTRO activities will be complementary to the actions for digital skills development implemented by 
Erasmus+ and the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT). This will be possible especially 
thanks to the coordination of this project by EIT Digital, one of the Knowledge Innovation Communities (KICs) of 
the EIT. Thanks to its ecosystem, including more than 300 partners as of December 2022, EIT Digital will be able 
to connect and stay updated with universities in the ecosystem participating to relevant Erasmus+ projects. 
Thanks to the coordination and involvement of EIT Digital in the project, we will also pursue an EIT Label 
certification19 for the two master’s programmes delivered by SPECTRO. The EIT Label is a unique certification 
focused on innovation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and leadership, based on the integration of business, 
education, and research in the so-called 'knowledge triangle'. An EIT Label certificate will be provided, on top of 
the double-degree, to students who successfully complete the master’s programmes. 
In addition to the above, SPECTRO will provide a European dimension and an added value in the following 
ways: 
• 
Training materials will be prepared, provided, and made accessible in English offering the possibility for 
students from any EU or EU-associated country to access to the master’s programmes and self-standing 
modules delivered by SPECTRO partners. 
• 
Training curricula will include good practices and analysis of business cases about digitalization 
development and deployment collected in project partners’ countries, leveraging on the added value of 
sharing lessons learned in other European countries.

• 
As the higher education institutions in SPECTRO consortium are expert institutions in the specific field 
of Cybersecurity and/or Robotics, they can effectively share their priorities and good practices of digital 
skills development in their key focus area to be included in the training materials of other universities. 
• 
A mechanism for exchange of guest lectures will be put in place so that, whenever needed and 
appropriate, each higher education institution in SPECTRO consortium will be able to leverage on staff 
from higher education institutions, research centres or SMEs in the consortium to support in teaching 
activities. Guest lectures in both online format and face-to-face format (thanks to a dedicated travel 
budget) will be organised by all SPECTRO higher education institutions. 
• 
All project partners will share interactively the insights on the findings of the labour market needs to 
widen their respective knowledge on the market and development status in different technology fields.

Contribution to long-term policy objectives, policies, and strategies — Synergies 
Relevant European and national policy strategies and initiatives 
In Europe, more than 90% of professional roles require a basic level of digital knowledge, just as they require 
basic literacy and numeracy skills. Moreover, the use of digital is spreading across all sectors, from business to 
transport and even to farming. However, around 42% of Europeans lack basic digital skills, including 37% of 
those in the workforce. To tackle this gap in digital skills, the European Commission has developed a range of 
policies and initiatives to enhance citizens’ competences and skills for the digital transition, investing in 
programmes to train Europeans and expand the talent pool in Europe. These programmes include:

Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition 
The European Skills Agenda is a five-year plan to help European citizens and businesses develop the skills 
required to strengthen sustainable competitiveness (as set out in the European Green Deal), ensure social 
fairness, and build resilience to react to crises, also based on the lessons learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The agenda includes 12 actions, including a call to join forces in a collective action (Pact for Skills) and actions 
to ensure that people have the right skills for jobs. These actions are focused on various strategic goals, including 
strengthening skills intelligence, fostering entrepreneurial and transversal skills, and providing skills to support 
the twin transitions. 
The Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) is the European Commission’s flagship policy initiative in this 
domain. The Action Plan aims to support the sustainable and effective adaptation of EU Member States' 
education and training systems to the digital age. It outlines the direction in which education and training systems 
in Europe should head, with the goal of reforming and modernising education and training systems so that they 
can match the most recent digital developments. The Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) aims to enhance 
the digital skills of people at different life and career stages, including young employees, and job seekers of any 
age. The goal is to ensure that the skills provided by the education and training programme in Europe offer the 
opportunity to people to find suitable jobs within a fast-changing labour market. The Action Plan sets two priority 
areas: 1) Developing a high-performing digital education ecosystem, and 2) Improving digital skills and 
competences for the digital transformation. The first priority area includes infrastructure, connectivity and 
digital equipment as well as digitally competent and confident teachers and education and training staff. The 
second priority area requires basic digital skills and competences from an early age as well as advanced digital 
skills and a good understanding of data-intensive technologies for the current workforce. 
The Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition aims to bring together EU Member States, companies, and organisations 
to tackle the digital skills gap. This European initiative addresses the lack of digital skills in Europe and consists 
of four pillars: 1) digital skills for all, 2) digital skills for the labour force, 3) digital skills for ICT professionals, 4) 
digital skills in education. The Coalition hopes to train 1 million young unemployed people for vacant digital jobs 
through traineeships or short-term training programmes, support the upskilling and retraining of the workforce 
with a particular focus on SMEs, as well as support awareness-raising activities about the importance of digital 
skills for employability, competitiveness, and participation in society. The European Digital Skills and Jobs 
Platform was launched under the Coalition to help address the skills gap in Europe. The platform aims to offer 
a wide variety of resources, including insights into EU/national initiatives in digital skills, training opportunities, 
career development support, good practices, expert advice, funding opportunities, news, opinions, and events. 
In the field of Cybersecurity, since the adoption of the first EU Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013, the European 
Commission has stepped up its efforts to better protect Europeans online. It has adopted a set of legislative 

 
11 
 
proposals, especially on network and information security, earmarked more than €600 million of EU investment 
for research and innovation in cybersecurity projects during the 2014-2020 period, and fostered cooperation 
within the EU and with partners on the global stage. 
In December 2020, the European Commission and the European External Action Service presented a new EU 
Cybersecurity strategy. The aim of this strategy is to strengthen Europe’s resilience against cyber threats and 
ensure that all citizens and businesses can fully benefit from trustworthy and reliable services and digital tools. 
The new strategy contains concrete proposals for deploying regulatory, investment and policy instruments. In 
March 2021, the Council adopted conclusions on the Cybersecurity strategy, underlining that Cybersecurity is 
essential for building a resilient, green, and digital Europe. EU ministers set as a key objective achieving strategic 
autonomy while preserving an open economy. This includes reinforcing the ability to make autonomous choices 
Cybersecurity, with the aim to strengthen the EU's digital leadership and strategic capacities. 
The EU is also working on two legislative proposals to address current and future online and offline risks: 1) 
an updated directive to better protect network and information systems, and 2) a new directive on the resilience 
of critical entities. These legislations will follow up on the EU Cybersecurity Act, which entered into force in 
June 2019 and introduced 1) an EU-wide certification scheme and 2) a new and stronger mandate for the EU 
Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA). ENISA will have a key role in setting up and maintaining the European 
cybersecurity certification framework by preparing the technical ground for specific certification schemes and by 
overseeing informing the public on the certification schemes and the issued certificates through a dedicated 
website. 
Cybersecurity remains one of the EU’s priorities in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen 
increased cyberattacks. The EU plan in Cybersecurity includes large investments in this area through the 
Horizon Europe programme and Digital Europe programme. In these two programmes, the EU has 
committed to invest to boost innovation in Cybersecurity and Privacy Systems and invest into Cybersecurity 
capacity and the wide deployment of cybersecurity infrastructures and tools across the EU, for public 
administrations, businesses, and individuals. 
When it comes to Robotics, the EU actively promotes research, job creation and innovation through better and 
safer robots, while safeguarding ethical aspects of the progress achieved. Through a portfolio of research 
projects and coordination actions, the European Commission has progressively built up a solid base of 
knowledge-sharing and cooperation across the entire robotics stakeholder community. This base now includes 
a public-private-partnership on robotics called SPARC, together with a six-year investment of €2.8 billion. 
The European Commission has also launched several initiatives to develop solutions involving Artificial 
Intelligence and Robotics. For example, in 2020 the European Commission launched an initiative to collect 
ideas about deployable Artificial Intelligence and Robotics solutions as well as information on other initiatives 
that could help face the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. The initiative aimed to create a unique repository that is easily 
accessible to all citizens, stakeholders and policymakers and become part of the common European response 
to the outbreak of COVID-19. Additionally, the European Commission and the AI, Data and Robotics Association 
(Adra) signed a Memorandum of Understanding for an AI, Data and Robotics partnership. The partnership 
leverages €1.3 billion of public investments through the Horizon Europe programme and €1.3 billion of private 
investments in the period 2021-2030 to address the key challenges in European AI, Data and Robotics.

SPECTRO contribution to policy strategies and initiatives 
The activities carried out in the SPECTRO project will be aligned and will contribute to the European and national 
policy strategies and digital skills initiatives listed above. 
SPECTRO will contribute to the long-term policy objectives, policies, and strategies to enhance citizens’ 
competences and skills for the digital transition, in line with the goals of the European Skills Agenda, Digital 
Education Action Plan (2021-2027), and Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition. 
The activities and education programmes delivered by SPECTRO partners will contribute to at least 3 actions 
out of the 12 actions included in the European Skills Agenda, namely Action 1: A Pact for Skills, Action 6: Skills 
to support the twin transitions, Action 7: Increasing STEM graduates and fostering entrepreneurial and 
transversal skills. SPECTRO objectives are in line with goal of the Pact for Skills, which invite private 
organisations to join forces and take concrete action to upskill people in Europe. This will be done via the delivery 
of self-standing modules leading to certifications. Synergies with the Pact of Skills activities will be strengthened 
thanks to the project coordination by EIT Digital, which has recently signed the Pact for Skills. SPECTRO training 
activities will also contribute to Action 6: Skills to support the twin transitions, Action 7: Increasing STEM 
graduates and fostering entrepreneurial and transversal skills, providing participants essential skills for the twin 
transitions to a green and digital Europe and offering master’s programmes in STEM with a minor specialty in 
Innovation and Entrepreneurship. 
SPECTRO activities are in synergy with the Digital Education Action Plan, especially to its priority area 2: 
Enhancing digital skills and competences for the digital transformation. SPECTRO will contribute to improve the 
knowledge and understanding in key digital technology areas, such as Cybersecurity and AI application in 
Robotics. The Master’s programme and learning modules offered by SPECTRO partners will increase the overall 
understanding and use of advanced digital skills in Europe, increasing the number of available digital specialists 
on the European market. This will be beneficial for employers in Europe, who are actively seeking employees 
with digital skills to adapt to an increasingly digitalised environment. 
SPECTRO will contribute to the Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition. The project will mainly focus on digital skills, 
providing Master students and learners completing SPECTRO modules with both theoretical knowledge and 
practical skills to use strategic digital technologies for Europe such as Cybersecurity and Robotics. Additionally, 
SPECTRO activities will be aligned with the EU Cybersecurity Act thanks to the development of new 

 
13 
 
certifications schemes for digital specialists and with other European initiatives aimed at application of Artificial 
Intelligence in Robotics. This particular aspect will be tackled by SPECTRO partners by offering self-standing 
modules on the topic and by offering to EU students master’s Programme specialisations with a focus on the 
application of AI and Machine Learning in Autonomous Systems (see Section 4 for further details on the 
specialisations of the SPECTRO master’s programme in Autonomous Systems and Intelligent Robots). 
On a European scale, it is becoming clear that the digital skills gap comes at a cost. SPECTRO will offer learning 
modules aiming at reducing such digital skills gap and improving the talent supply chain for digital roles. The 
contribution to long-term policy objectives and strategy from the European Commission will be complemented 
by connecting with other relevant EU initiatives. Priority will be given to EU initiatives and programmes where 
some of the SPECTRO partners will be involved, such as European Digital Innovation Hubs and European 
Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT), but also other relevant running EU projects (e.g. the project selected 
from the Call DIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-01- ANALYSIS Advanced Digital Skills Analysis, the projects selected from 
the Calls DIGITAL-2022-TRAINING-02-SHORT-COURSES Short-term training programmes in key capacity 
areas and Call DIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-02-SPECIALISED Specialised Master’s programmes in key capacity 
areas). In addition to these initiatives, SPECTRO partners will also pursue synergies with relevant coalition and 
partnerships at European level in Robotics and Cybersecurity (e.g. SPARC, Adra). 
In addition to contribution to policy strategies and synergies with initiatives on a European scale, SPECTRO 
activities and education programmes will contribute to long-term policy objectives, policies, and strategies at the 
level of EU Member States. Thanks to the development and delivery of specialised education programmes in 
the fields of Cybersecurity and Robotics, SPECTRO will contribute to addressing the skill needs in several EU 
countries in line with national policies, such as the Italian Strategy for Digital Skills, the Digitalisation 
Strategy 2.0 in the Netherlands, or the French National Plan for Digital Inclusion. Cybersecurity will be one 
of the focus areas of SPECTRO, with partners in the consortium developing a pan-European Master’s 
programme in Cybersecurity and offering self-standing modules at different level on the topic. The education 
programmes will contribute at training specialists in Cybersecurity across all EU Member States and help to 
meet the objectives of several national programmes, such as Romania’s Cybersecurity Strategy 2.0, Italy’s 
National Cybersecurity Strategy, or Finland’s Cybersecurity Strategy. The EU citizens trained by 
SPECTRO will contribute to offering protection of national strategic assets and responding to national cyber 
threats, incidents, and crises across EU countries.

Implementation plan and efficient use of resources 
Implementation plan 
The SPECTRO implementation plan is sketched in Figure 2. The project is organised around four blocks, which 
are reflected in four different Work Packages (WPs): 
• 
The first block will focus on designing and delivering a pan-European master’s programme in 
Cybersecurity offering possibility to study in the following countries: Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, 
Netherlands, and Romania. Mobility between different European countries, strong connection with 
business, and innovation and entrepreneurship education will be the key characteristics of the master’s 
programme. This block will also focus on the development and deployment of self-standing modules 
on Cybersecurity. The modules will lead to certifications that will be implemented by SPECTRO 
partners during the first year of the project. 
• 
The second block of activities will focus on designing and delivering a pan-European Master’s 
programme in Robotics offering possibility to study in the following countries: Finland, France, 
Hungary, Italy, and Sweden. This master’s programme will have the same structure and key 
characteristics of the master’s Programme in Cybersecurity. As part of this block of activities, self-
standing modules on Robotics will be developed and deployed. These modules will lead to 
certifications that will be implemented by SPECTRO partners as explained in next sections. 
• 
The third block will provide the required marketing, promotion, communication, and dissemination 
activities needed to attract the target audience to the two master’s programme and self-standing 
learning modules. The activities carried out within this block will also aim to maximise the impact and 
outreach of SPECTRO education programmes. 
• 
The abovementioned blocks will be complemented by a fourth block on education programme 
management, project management, and partnership management. This block will facilitate successful 
execution and coordination of the activities. Successful delivery of an inclusive scholarship programme 
and effective partnership coordination will be also ensured thanks to this block. Overall, the activities 
carried out within this block will make sure that the SPECTRO project delivers excellent education 
programmes and high- quality outcomes, in line with the four specific objectives of the project.

dedicated marketing and promotion activities, and which mechanism will be put in place to ensure students’ 
mobilities between partners and to establish sustainable partnerships within the project. 
Implementation plan | Master’s programmes  
As part of WP1 and WP2 activities, SPECTRO partners will design and deliver 2 master’s programmes, which 
will be denoted as follows: 
• 
Master’s programme in Cybersecurity, and  
• 
Master’s programme in Autonomous Systems and Intelligent Robots. 
The two master’s programmes will last two years. During the duration of SPECTRO project, two full cycles of 
the two programmes will be completed according to the following timeline: 
• 
First cycle. Recruitment period: December 2023 – May 2024, First Year: September 2024 – July 2025, 
Second Year: September 2025 – July 2026 
• 
Second cycle. Recruitment period: December 2024 – May 2025, First Year: September 2025 – July 
2026, Second Year: September 2026 – July 2027. 
The two master’s programmes will be double-degree programmes (ISCED Level 7, 120 ECTS). Students 
graduating from the two programmes will receive a double degree from two different higher education institutions 
from two different countries (studying in two different countries will be a mandatory condition of the programmes). 
The double degree titles will be awarded according to the following general degrees and legal frameworks: 
• 
Master’s Programme in Cybersecurity à Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Computer Science 
• 
Master’s Programme in Autonomous Systems and Intelligent Robots à Master of Science (M.Sc.) in 
Engineering or Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Computer Science Engineering or Master of Science 
(M.Sc.) in Automation Engineering – depending on the country of the university awarding the degree 
title. 
EITD and the participating universities to the master’s programmes will pursue an EIT Label certification for the 
two master’s programmes during the duration of the SPECTRO project. This means that the programmes will 
be developed according to the high-quality standards of the EIT, but also that student graduating from the two 
master’s programmes will receive an EIT Label Certificate on top of their double-degree title. 
 
Figure 2. Structure of SPECTRO Master’s programmes, including the I&E minor specialty. 
The two master’s programmes will be built in parallel, building on the already existing structure of the EIT Digital 
Master School programmes. The programme development process will involve many opportunities for partners 
from both master’s programmes to learn from each other. The two master’s programmes will be developed 
following the same principles and will have the same structure, which is summarised in Figure 2. The key 
characteristics of the two programmes will be the following: 
• 
Minor specialty in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E) for a total of 30 ECTS. This minor 
specialty includes 24 ECTS to be completed in the first year, including:  
1) a mandatory course on I&E Basics and a Business Development Lab course (15 ECTS in 
total), 
2) an elective I&E course (5 ECTS) which can be chosen by students based on the options made 
available by each partner institution,  
3) 4 ECTS awarded via an EIT Digital Summer course on how to turn innovative digital 
technologies into business. The summer courses will be mandatory to all Masters’ students. 
Partner universities will organize different summer courses on different topics, every master 
student will have to participate to one of them. 

 
22 
 
The remaining 6 ECTS of the I&E minor specialty will be completed by students in the second year of 
their studies through an I&E study with Business Challenges. The business challenges will be 
provided by the SMEs in SPECTRO consortium and by other SMEs in the network of SPECTRO 
partners. 
• 
Mobility: Students will study each year in a different higher education institution in a different country, 
with the higher education institutions awarding a double degree to students. The two higher education 
institutions will be denoted hereafter as Entry University (where a student studies the first year) and 
Exit University (where a student studies the second year). 
• 
Internship: An internship during the second year of studies will be mandatory for all students. 
SPECTRO partners will define an effective mechanism to collect internship opportunities from 
corporates and SMEs across Europe, mainly leveraging on the local networks of every SPECTRO 
partner. GIM will have an important role in definition of the internship programme, ensuring that the 
programme will be put in place in terms that are suitable and advantageous for SMEs. The Internship 
programme will be built on the already existing EIT Digital Internship Programme22 and will facilitate for 
students to find relevant research and business internship opportunities in their country or abroad. 
• 
Specialisations: Every higher education institution acting as Exit University will offer students a 
different specialisation (24 ECTS). In line with SO1 - Addressing skill needs, specialisations will offer 
students the opportunity to address the needs of a specific application sector or to deep dive on specific 
ethical applications of digital technologies. The full list of specialisations offered in the two master’s 
programmes is available in Section 4, in the descriptions of Task 1.1 and task 2.1. 
• 
Cooperation with business: The courses taught in the master’s programmes by each higher 
education institution will include several guest lecturers/seminars from other SPECTRO partners, 
including other higher education institutions, SMEs and IRISA research centre. The provision of guest 
lecturers will be facilitated through the implementation of mechanisms for inclusion of guest lectures (in 
online or face-to-face format). Guest lectures, together with the internship programme, and the I&E 
minor specialty will allow students to benefit from the knowledge and experience from people not only 
from higher education institutions, but also from actors (including but not limited to GIM, and IRISA) 
from all sides of the knowledge integration triangle. Thanks to the internship programme and other 
actions, the level of collaboration with industry will be very high and not limited to the few partners 
included in the SPECTRO consortium. 
The combination of these key characteristics is unique, and a clear added value compared to the vast majority 
of master’s programme on the European market. Thus, the SPECTRO consortium will be able to position its 
programmes in a privileged position. This will ensure high traction and high attractiveness of SPECTRO master’s 
programmes, both from the point of view of students and teaching staff. Although, the SPECTRO partners 
already have most teaching staff required for the master’s programme among their staff members, the missing 
vacancies are expected to be filled by high-qualified teaching staff who will be attracted by the unique 
characteristics of SPECTRO programmes, contributing to the achievement of SO2 – Attracting qualified teaching 
staff and students. 
In comparison with the already existing EIT Digital Master School programmes, the master’s programmes 
developed in the SPECTRO project will involve 1) a significantly higher degree of collaboration with 
business and research, with a significant participation of these actors in the teaching and internship 
programmes, 2) new specialisations focused on cutting-edge technologies and their application in specific 
market sector (e.g. Post-Quantum Cryptography or application of Robotics in Healthcare), 3) a brand new set 
of learning modules on topics connected to the master’s programmes, to which students enrolled in the 
master’s programmes can access to gain complementary knowledge from other universities across Europe. 
The higher education institutions in the SPECTRO consortium will be involved in the two master’s programmes 
either as Entry or Exit University according to the map in Table 1. The Master’s programme in Cybersecurity will 
offer students the possibility of studying at 6 Entry Universities and 6 Exit Universities from 6 different 
countries, while the master’s programme in Autonomous Systems and Intelligent Robots will offer students the 
possibility of studying at 7 Entry Universities and 8 Exit Universities from 6 different countries. Whenever 
involved as Entry or Exit university, a partner will contribute to awarding the double-degree title provided to 
students who successfully complete the master’s programme.

Table 1. Involvement of SPECTRO higher education institutions in the two master’s programmes. 
An important aspect of the master’s programmes is that they will involve partners from several different 
countries, including countries where advanced digital skills levels are low according to the Digital Economy and 
Society Index, such as Romania and Hungary. The partners from these countries will be able to learn best 
practices from countries in which the use of digital technologies is widespread, such as Finland and Sweden. 
The curricula of both master’s programmes will be developed in line with EU values and ethics. Dedicated 
short courses on ethics and trustworthy application of technology will be included as part of the I&E by every 
higher education institution. Additionally, the curricula will be developed by aligning with the latest technology 
developments in Cybersecurity and Robotics thanks to the preparation activities carried out as part of Task 
1.1 and Task 2.1 (see descriptions in Section 4), which will involve review activities and knowledge exchanges 
between SPECTRO partners to learn from each other, improving and aligning their curricula with the market 
needs and state-of-the-art technologies. 
All students will be required to participate to a summer course in the period between the end of the entry year 
and the beginning for the exit year of their Masters’. Different universities within the consortium will host different 
two-week summer courses, each centred on various themes related to the applications of digital technologies. 
Every student will have the possibility to choose, in the global offering, the course they prefer to attend. All of 
the students will need to participate to 1 and only 1 summer school to obtain the associated credits needed to 
complete the Masters’ programme. To participate in this program, students will receive financial support in the 
form of a lump sum reimbursement for their travel expenses. The reimbursement amount will vary based on 
geographical zone and the timing of the summer courses to account for different expenses. This approach 
ensures equal access and opportunity for all students attending the summer courses organized by the project. 
As part of the activities that will be performed to achieve SO3 - Developing structural and sustainable 
partnerships, actions to encourage the mobility of the teaching staff across the partners of the SPECTRO 
consortium will be put in place, as further explained below. 
Implementation plan | Self-standing learning modules 
On top of the two master’s programmes, as part of WP1 and WP2 activities, SPECTRO partners will deliver a 
set of self-standing modules on topics related to the master’s programmes. The focus of the modules will 
be on Robotics and Cybersecurity, although the modules will also include dedicated sections to Innovation 
and Entrepreneurship and Ethics in the application of digital technologies. 
In total, SPECTRO will deliver at least 25 self-standing modules. The tentative list of these modules is 
provided in Section 4 in the descriptions of Task 1.2 and Task 2.2. 
The design, development, and delivery of each single module will be coordinated by one of the higher 
education institutions in the SPECTRO consortium. Whenever needed and appropriate, the partner 
coordinating a module will leverage on the support of other partners in the consortium, including not only the 
higher education institutions but also the research centre and SMEs. In particular, the SMEs and IRISA will 
contribute by providing technical challenges on Robotics and Cybersecurity and will also contribute to part of 
the teaching content. 
Although developed by different organisations, all modules will be built and delivered following common 
principles. Harmonisation of the curricula and formats of the modules will be ensured by the leaders of 
Task 1.2 and Task 2.2, and by the overarching activities carried out within Task 4.2 (see Section 4, Task 4.2 
description for further details). Common principles will be applied not only during the design and development 
phase, but also during the delivery phase. 
The self-standing learning modules will include: 
• an asynchronous part in online format that participants can follow at their own pace, including online 
lectures, exercises, and business challenges, 
• in most cases, live classes that will be mandatory for participants to successfully complete modules. The 
live classes will serve for participants to interact with the lecturers involved in the asynchronous part of the 
modules to ask questions and clarifications, but also as a teaching space to cover some crucial of the 
learning outcomes of each module. Live classes will be mostly held in online format. However, in case of 
high participation of local students/professionals from the same region of the higher education institution 
coordinating the module, live classes could be done in face-to-face format or hybrid format. 

 
24 
 
Some of the self-standing modules will be also included as part of the courses included in the master’s 
programmes. This will offer the possibility to higher education institutions to include as part of their own 
curricula some teaching content from another higher education institutions, possibly from another country, 
increasing the diversity and attractiveness of the courses offered within SPECTRO Master’s programmes.  
Independently from the fact that the modules are included in the curriculum of one of the master’s programmes, 
all self-standing learning modules will be open to external participants. External participants will be able to 
follow the learning modules: 
• as stand-alone modules offering a certificate of completion issued jointly by EITD and the higher 
education institution coordinating each module, or  
• as part of specific learning paths offering participants the possibility to obtain a certification at the end 
of the learning path. The certification schemes developed by SPECTRO partners will involve: 
1. mandatory completion of a specific set of modules, 
2. a final certification exam consisting of a theoretical exam and a practical exam. 
The design and development of the certification schemes will be carried out during the first year of the project. 
It will be coordinated by EITD with the support of UT, following the example of the already existing certification 
in Cybersecurity offered by EITD (see the certification scheme for the course Becoming a Cybersecurity 
Consultant23). The design of the certification schemes will involve all the higher education institutions 
developing online modules within the SPECTRO project. The theoretical and practical exams will be hosted 
on a third-party platform, with dedicated sub-contracting budget allocated in the proposal. 
SPECTRO partners envisage to develop 4 certification schemes, two in the field of Cybersecurity and two in 
Robotics. The main difference between the two certifications in the same area will be in the level of expertise 
offered by the certifications, with one certification being at entry level and one of the certifications being at 
expert level. In particular: 
• 
the entry-level certifications will target people without a degree or considerable knowledge and work 
experience in the domain of Cybersecurity or Robotics, 
• 
the expert-level certifications will target people with a degree in Computer Science and similar fields 
or with significant work experience in the areas. 
Market research will be carried out at the start of the project (see Section 4, Task 1.2, Task 2.2, and Task 3.1 
description) to further detail and identify the best target audience for each certification scheme. The name of 
the certifications and the learning objectives for each certification will be defined in detail during the first year 
of the project based on the result of the market research. 
All modules will be made available to any country in Europe. A single digital learning platform will be used 
for all modules. This platform will be managed and coordinated by EITD. All courses available on the learning 
platform will be available in English language. However, SPECTRO partners will the possibility to have the 
live classes (in either online or face-to-face format) delivered in the local language when required by 
participants. 
Registration to SPECTRO self-standing learning modules will be as simple as possible for participants. 
Registration to all courses will be possible via a single registration page, managed by EITD but made 
accessible to all SPECTRO consortium partners. For each learning module, a Module Manager from the 
higher education institution coordinating the module will be appointed. This manager will be responsible to 
evaluate the application to the module. Additionally, the Module Manager will coordinate with the lecturers 
involved in the live classes and grading of the exercises.  
To maximise the audience and facilitate the participation of job seekers and citizens in needs of up-skilling or 
re-skilling and with a low income, all courses will be offered for free. The modules developed by SPECTRO 
partners will be advertised on the EITD website, which will also include the registration portal. This page will 
be advertised on other relevant webpages and on the Digital Skills and Jobs Platform. 
Enrolment process 
The enrolment to the two master’s programmes and self-standing learning modules will be coordinated by 
EITD with the support of:  
• 
Task 1.1 Leader, Task 2.1 Leader, and one Local Programme Coordinator from each higher education 
institution in the enrolment process to the two master’s Programmes, 
• 
Task 1.2 Leader, Task 2.2 Leader, and the Modules Managers in the enrolment process of participants 
to the self-standing learning modules.

Section 2.3 provides the full list of people that will be appointed as WP1 Leader, WP2 Leader, Task 1.1 Leader, 
Task 1.2 Leader, Local Programme Coordinators at each university for each master’s Programme. 
All activities related to the enrolment process will be performed within Task 4.3, which will be coordinated by 
EITD and involve the participation of all other SPECTRO partners. 
Enrolment process | Master’s programmes 
The two master’s programmes will have a flat tuition fee, meaning that the tuition fee will be unvaried, 
independently from the higher education institutions and country of application.  The tuition fee will be collected 
by EITD and partially reimbursed to the higher education institutions based on the local tuition fee. The flat rate 
tuition fee will simplify the enrolment process and the promotion of the master’s programmes. The SPECTRO 
partners are aware that a flat tuition fee might hinder and discourage the applications from applicants from 
countries with low gross domestic product, for this reason a specific scholarship programme will be put in place 
to support the participation of students from those countries (as further explained in the next section). 
Enrolment to the two master’s programmes will be done via a single enrolment portal, which will be made 
created and managed by EITD. The portal will be an integrated part of the already existing EIT Digital Master 
School enrolment portal. Processing of personal data will be done according to EU regulations, following to 
the procedures defined in Task 4.5. All Local Programme Coordinators will have access to the portal and 
visibility of the status of all open applications.  When enrolling to one of the two master’s programmes, 
applicants will be given the opportunity to select 3 options as Entry University and 3 options as Exit 
University with order of priority. The main reason for offering multiple options is to give students more options 
since different higher education institutions have different requirements (e.g. in terms of English certification 
or in terms of minimum Bachelor’s degree results). Applicants who cannot be accepted by the higher education 
institution of their highest preference might still can still be accepted by another higher education institution. At 
the same time, the capacity of every higher education institution is limited. The multiple-option offer will ensure 
that a higher number of applications is process, even if some higher education institutions will reach their 
maximum capacity. To apply to the two SPECTRO Master’s programme, participants will be required to upload: 
1. Degree Certificate/Diploma in its original language and translated into English. In case of on-going 
studies, a statement written by the degree administration office (or equivalent department) will be require, 
certifying that the applicant is in his/her final year of studies.  
2. Official transcript of records in original language and translated into English. 
3. Proof of English proficiency. The requirement of English proficiency will vary depending on the higher 
education institution/country selected by the applicant. 
4. Curriculum Vitae including details on academic and professional career of the applicant. 
5. A letter of motivation (maximum 3 pages) to prove the innovative potential of the applicant and his/her 
need for financial support. In this letter applicants will be required to discuss and/or propose an 
entrepreneurial idea and to explain their financial situation and need for financial support. 
6. Supporting documents regarding the applicant’s financial situation (e.g. credit report). 
7. An official ID, such as passport or National ID. 
EITD will perform a preliminary check of the received applications to ensure that applications include the 
required documentation. After preliminary checks are completed, the applications will be transferred to Task 
1.1 and Task 2.1 Leaders who will review the applications in detail together with the Local Programme 
Coordinators of the universities selected by the applicants as Entry or Exit options. The order of preference 
selected by applicants will be respected, with the Local Programme Coordinators from the university selected 
as option 2 (or option 3) reviewing an application only after the applicant has not been accepted from the 
university selected as option 1 (or option 2).  
The applications review process, including the review from Task 1.1 and Task 1.2 Leaders and the Local 
Programme Coordinators, will take about two months. To offer applicants more flexibility about the time of 
applications, 2 Recruitment Periods will be open in every recruitment year. The tentative timeline for these 
Recruitment Periods will be the following:  
• Period 1: Recruitment opening: November 15th, Recruitment closing: January 30th, Letter of acceptance 
sent: March 30th, Deadline to accept: April 7th. Academic year start: September. 
• Period 2: Recruitment opening: February 1st, Recruitment closing: April 15th, Letter of acceptance sent: 
May 30th, Deadline to accept: June 7th. Academic year start: September. 
Both Period 1 and Period 2 will be open to EU students. However, due to the time required for visa application, 
only Period 1 will be open to non-EU applicants.  
The allocation of scholarships will be done at the end of the review process and before sending the letter of 
acceptance. This way, communication about awarded scholarships will be provided to applicants at the 
time the letters of acceptance are sent to applicants. EITD is applying a similar recruitment process, with 

 
26 
 
similar timeline, since several years as part of the EIT Digital Master School. The process has been improved 
through years and the format and timeline proposed here were proved to be the most effective. 
These scholarships will be distributed to students by EIT Digital Education Foundation. This Foundation was 
established specifically for collecting, distributing and managing support to EITD master school students and 
has a status of education institution in Belgium (as well as tax ruling, ensuring no profit is distributed to owners 
of the foundation but reinvested into the functioning of EITD ecosystem, which in turn guarantees the 
integration of knowledge triangle, part of which is functioning support scheme for Master School students). The 
scholarship distribution process will involve different steps and actors: (1) application evaluation: during the 
recruitment cycles, EIT Digital, in collaboration with all the partner universities, will evaluate scholarship 
application; (2) Ranking and decision: based on the results of the evaluation process, the final decision on 
scholarship allocation to students will be taken; (3) once the decisions are finalized, the EIT Digital Education 
Foundation will distribute the scholarships according to the approved allocations from the recruitment cycle. 
By providing scholarships aimed at fostering diversity, promoting gender inclusion, and assisting low-income 
individuals, we are committed to targeting underrepresented groups. This initiative is designed to ensure 
equitable representation across genders and socio-economic backgrounds, thereby encouraging engagement 
from those who might not otherwise have access to these educational opportunities due to financial constraints. 
Enrolment process | Self-standing learning modules 
In a similar way to the enrolment to the master’s programmes, the enrolment to the self-standing learning 
modules will be done via a single enrolment portal. The enrolment portal will be on the same platform where 
the courses will be available. The portal and enrolment process will be coordinated by EITD, but all SPECTRO 
partners will have access and visibility to the enrolment portal.  
To apply to a self-standing module, participants will need to register to the portal. Registration will be simple, 
requiring only a limited number of basic details to participants (e.g. name, address, nationality, age) and a 
prove of identification, such as passport or National ID. Registrations will be reviewed on a rolling basis by the 
platform manager appointed by EITD. Once the registration is approved, it will allow application to any of the 
modules made available on the platform (i.e. all modules developed by SPECTRO partners).  
Applications to the modules including only asynchronous content and without live classes will be available any 
time, while applications to the modules including live classes (either online or in face-to-face format) will be 
available at specific time window. The schedule of live classes will be aligned with the academic semester. 
Thus, every year 2 periods will be available according to the following timeline: 
• Period 1: Registration opening: June 1st. Registration closing: September 20th. Acceptance on a rolling 
basis. Module start date: October 1st. Module end date: December 20th. 
• Period 2: Registration opening: October 1st. Registration closing: January 20th. Acceptance on a rolling 
basis. Module start date: February 1st. Module end date: April 30th. 
At the end of each period, a window of duration of one month (i.e. in January and in May) will be available for 
participants who successfully completed the online modules to take certification exams. During the one-
month window multiple dates will be made available to take the certification exams. Only participants who have 
completed the self-standing modules required by a certification scheme will be admitted to the certification 
exams. Participant can complete the self-standing modules required by each certification across several 
periods. This is a possibility that is offered considering working professionals, who need to combine the 
modules with their work commitments. 
A scholarship programme based on merit and promoting diversity 
A scholarship programme for EU students will be put in place to support the best applicants during their 
two years of studies in one of the double-degree in master’s programmes offered by SPECTRO. These 
scholarships will be distributed to students by EIT Digital Education Foundation. This Foundation was 
established specifically for collecting, distributing and managing support to EITD master school students and 
has a status of education institution in Belgium (as well as tax ruling, ensuring no profit is distributed to owners 
of the foundation but reinvested into the functioning of EITD ecosystem, which in turn guarantees the 
integration of knowledge triangle, part of which is functioning support scheme for Master School students). The 
scholarship distribution process will involve different steps and actors: (1) application evaluation: during the 
recruitment cycles, EIT Digital, in collaboration with all the partner universities, will evaluate scholarship 
application; (2) Ranking and decision: based on the results of the evaluation process, the final decision on 
scholarship allocation to students will be taken; (3) once the decisions are finalized, the EIT Digital Education 
Foundation will distribute the scholarships according to the approved allocations from the recruitment cycle. 
The scholarship programme will award applicants based on merit. To quantify merit, a merit score (on a 
scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the maximum) will be given to each applicant accepted to one of the master’s 
programmes. Three elements will be considered in assigning a merit score: 1) previous academic and 
professional experience of an applicant, 2) curriculum vitae, and 3) letter of motivation, which also includes the 

 
27 
 
motivation for an applicant to receive financial support. The initial merit score value will be an average of the 
two merit scores assigned by the two Local Programme Coordinators accepting an applicant (the Local 
Coordinator at the Entry University and the Local Coordinator at the Exit University). The merit scores assigned 
by Local Programme Coordinators will be reviewed by WP1 Leader and WP2 Leader to ensure uniformity 
between the scores given by Local Programme Coordinators from different universities and different countries. 
A final meeting including the WP Leader, all Local Programme Coordinators and Task 4.3 leader will be set at 
the end of each Recruitment Period to agree and deliberate on the final merit score of each applicant. 
In line with SO4 - Supporting students while promoting diversity, the scholarship programme will promote 
diversity in terms of gender, age, social and economic background. To achieve this objective, the 
SPECTRO scholarship programme will include different scholarship opportunities, including: 
• 
an overarching scholarship programme - available to any applicant from any EU country or EU-
associated country, 
• 
a scholarship programme for women - available only to female applicants from any EU country or EU- 
associated country, 
• 
a scholarship programme for participants from RIS countries - available only to applicants from 
country included in the EIT Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS)24. 
The scholarship programme for women will be created to increase female participation in master’s 
programmes in Computer Science and Engineering in Europe, such as the programmes offered by SPECTRO. 
At present, across all European countries, less than 20% of graduates in Computer Science are women25. 
Female participation should be considerably increased. SPECTRO has the ambitious target to reach at least 
30% of female graduates from its education programmes (see Section 3).  
The scholarship programme for participants from RIS countries is aimed to support the participation of students 
from countries with moderate or modest innovation score and with lower gross domestic product. 
Countries eligible to take part to the RIS include 1) EU members states, 2) Horizon Europe associated 
countries, and 3) outermost regions such as Guadeloupe, and Réunion (France), the Azores and Madeira 
(Portugal), and the Canary Islands (Spain). 
In each of the scholarship programmes, three types of scholarships will be available: 
• 
scholarship of excellence, including a full tuition fee waivers and a monthly allowance, 
• 
full tuition fee waivers, 
• 
half tuition fee waivers. 
The monthly allowance will be weighted based on the country correction coefficient (CCCs) of the country 
where a student is studying. Thus, the monthly allowance provided to a student it can vary between the first 
and second year of studies. The exact distribution of scholarships of each type in each scholarship programme 
will be decided by the SPECTRO consortium at the opening of each recruitment campaign. However, 
considering the allocated budget, SPECTRO partners plan to make available in every recruitment campaign 
at least 60 scholarships to be distributed among the two master’s programmes. 
Mobility and development of structural and sustainable partnerships 
To achieve SO3 - Developing structural and sustainable partnerships, actions to encourage the mobility of the 
teaching staff across the partners of the SPECTRO consortium will be put in place in the SPECTRO projects as 
part of Task 4.4 - Community, partnership, and mobility management. The actions will include: 
• Exchange of guest lecturers: All SPECTRO partners, including the SMEs and research centre, will form 
a pool of guest lectures available to travel on request at the premises of another SPECTRO partners to offer 
a small number of hours of guest lectures on a topic of expertise.  
• Exchange of business mentors: In a similar way to the exchange of guest lectures, a pool of business 
mentors will be created by SPECTRO partners for mentoring activities in the I&E minor specialty, namely in 
the Business Development Lab course offered by every Entry University and in the I&E study with Business 
Challenges offered by every Exit University. The business mentors will include representative of the SMEs 
and IRISA and staff from the higher education institutions, mainly representatives from the staff involved in 
the teaching of the I&E minor specialty in the master’s programmes. 
The actions above will be further complemented by many other actions or activities involving interactions 
between partners, such as:

• Knowledge sharing during and following the market analysis to understand and map the needs of the 
labour market (Task 1.1 and Task 1.2), 
• Joint development of certification schemes for the self-standing learning modules (Task 2.1 and Task 2.2), 
• Activities related to harmonisation of the curricula of the master’s programmes and self-standing learning 
modules (Task 4.2), 
• Design and implementation of an internship programme for students enrolled in the two master’s 
programmes (Task 1.1, Task 2.1, Task 4.4), 
• Joint marketing, promotion, communication, and dissemination, including joint participation to events for 
promotion and student recruitment (Task 3.1 and Task 3.2). 
We believe that such a set of different and complementary activities will contribute to establishing a high 
degree of interaction between all partners in the SPECTRO consortium, including partners from different 
sides of the knowledge integration triangle. Each partner in the consortium will have clear roles and tasks (see 
Section 2.3). This will considerably facilitate the partners’ contribution to the project and allow to develop 
structural and sustainable partnerships between the members of the consortium, allowing students to 
benefit from capacities and specialisms of multiple partners in the consortium. It can be estimated that each 
student enrolled to the master’s programmes will have the occasion to interact with at least 6 different 
partners, including the Entry and Exit Year higher education institutions, the internship provider, and at least 
three different guest lectures that will be involved in the courses taught during the two-year education 
programme. Thanks to the I&E minor specialty and internship, the partners will not be only limited to higher 
education institutions. The participants to the self-learning modules willing to achieve a certification will also 
have a similar level of interaction with partners, participating to modules coordinated by different higher 
education institutions that will involve guest lectures from other partners. 
Outreach | Marketing, promotion, communication, and dissemination 
The SPECTRO project will include a range of activities in marketing, promotion, communications, and 
dissemination to increase awareness about the SPECTRO education offer, engage with relevant stakeholders 
for promotion purposes and enhance long-term sustainability. These activities are expected to contribute to 
achieving SO2 - Attracting qualified teaching staff and students. 
All promotional tasks and activities will support the go-to-market strategy of the SPECTRO education offer, 
which will be described in D3.1 Marketing Plan, ensuring that the project results and outputs (master and 
learning module developed within the project) reach the relevant target audiences as widely as possible. These 
will comprise developing and deploying engaging promotional campaigns implemented according to a set of 
marketing and communication plans and specific timelines. 
On one hand, a comprehensive marketing plan led by EITD will serve as an overarching strategy for all 
communication dissemination efforts implemented by the consortium to reach out to established target groups 
at the local, regional, national, and European levels. It will be comprised of: 
• Marketing research for market relevance to identify the target audience in Europe for SPECTRO 
education offer. 
• Development of a marketing plan by EITD for the roll-out of the education programmes, covering 
elements needed for the communication and marketing campaign launch. 
• Marketing and promotion of the master’s programme and self-standing learning modules along with the 
marketing plan in collaboration with partners and overseen by EITD. 
As part of the marketing and promotion activities, EITD will make sure to liaise with the administrators of the 
Digital Skills and Jobs Platform and maximise the visibility of SPECTRO education programmes on this 
platform, which is at the heart of the European Digital Skills & Jobs Community. 
On the other hand, a dissemination plan will follow a multi-channel strategy, including: 
• Creating dedicated webpages on EIT Digital website, including a webpage for each master’s programme and 
a webpage for the self-standing learning modules and related certification schemes, 
• Presence on social media through organic reach within the consortium to extend the dissemination to 
SPECTRO target groups and grow the community, 
• Paid advertisement to create high visibility and grow the audience for the short-term courses, 
• Dissemination of information about SPECTRO programmes at events on the local, regional and EU level, 
• Exploring communication-related synergies with similar projects and initiatives, especially other projects 
funded via the Digital Europe Programme or via other relevant programmes, such as ERASMUS+ or the HEI 
Initiative: Innovation Capacity Building for Higher Education, 
• Connection and dissemination to other stakeholders and projects involved in similar technical domain, 

 
29 
 
including European Digital Innovation Hubs, 
• Creation of common promotional material to serve the consortium activities and objective with one 
common approach and brand identity, including visibility on the EU funding provided via the DIGITAL-
2022-SKILLS-03-SPECIALISED-EDU. 
In addition, a set of marketing and promotional activities will also support a structure that will be put in place to 
continue the implementation of the master’s programmes and modules beyond the project closure. 
 
Project Management, quality assurance and monitoring and evaluation strategy 
Project management  
SPECTRO implementation work plan requires effective project management to deliver high quality results. The 
project management approach chosen guarantees transparency and commitment to all partners and facilitates 
successful project execution. Consortium bodies and key actors in the management structure are depicted in 
the figure below. Table X provides a short description of the key roles in the consortium. Duties, responsibilities,

General Assembly (GEA). The GEA consists of management level representatives of all consortium partners, 
each having one vote. This is to ensure ownership of the results and to prove the commitment on all sides. It is 
chaired by the Project Coordinator. The GEA is the highest decision-making body in the project. It will assume 
overall responsibility for project conformance to the contract. The GEA deals with contractual issues escalated 
to it, or issues requiring GEA confirmation and/or voting according to the consortium agreement. The GEA 
ensures that the partners give continued support and adequate resources to the project; promotes the results 
of the project and acts as the final level of escalation, should serious conflicts arise during the project. In 
particular, the GEA is responsible for: 
• 
Major changes to the consortium, work plan or budgets, especially if requiring EC approval. 
• 
Review, quality check and approval of project deliverables and, more in general, of any public output 
• 
Guaranteeing confidentiality of internal project results/outputs designated as restricted to the consortium. 
• 
Establishing a controlling and reporting system for resource consumption and progress against schedule. 
• 
GEA delegates, as representatives of contractors, are responsible for: 1) Submission of correct financial 
and administrative data to the Project Coordinator, 2) Commitment of their own organisations, including 
financial matters and management of their internal resources. 
The role, decision responsibilities and powers of the GEA are specified in the Consortium Agreement 
Project Coordinator (PC) and Project Manager (PM). The PC will cooperate and exchange information with 
the project management (PM). 
The Project Coordinator (PC) is responsible for the management and coordination of the entire project. The 
PC also chairs and ensures proper operation of the key consortium bodies GEA and PEC. The PC reports to 
the GEA. Responsibilities include: 
• Execution of all project obligations vis-à-vis the Agency, including submission of project deliverables. 
• Acting as the intermediary between the partners and the EC / Project Officer (PO). 
• Calling PEC / GEA meetings, informing and chairing PEC and GEA. 
• Resolution of financial and contractual issues. 
• Overseeing the implementation of administrative processes. 
As the official interface between the consortium and the EC, the PC monitors project activities, maintains an 
up- to-date view of progress and will, where appropriate, suggest changes to the original work plan to ensure 
achievement of project objectives. The PC will be supported by the PM in ensuring all administrative objectives 
and obligations are met. In order to meet the scientific and technical goals, the PC is supported by WP Leaders 
in the context of the PEC. 
The Project Manager (PM) will work closely together with the PC function and ensures that the Project 
Coordinator receives all necessary support in coordination matters and in particular regarding annual cost 
statements, payments, budget allocations and audit certificates from each partner at the time of financial 
reporting. In addition, the PM is responsible for the following activities: 
• Dealing with all administrative issues arising in the project including data collection from partners 
• Preparing meetings with the project consortium, ensuring minutes are taken and approved. 
• Supporting the communication with the EC in general, and with respect to the preparation of review 
meetings, and the submission and approval of deliverables. 
• Financial Control: monitoring Financial Statements, feedback to the partners and the PC. 
• External relations: receive external requests and questions on project, provide interested parties with 
information issued by the project, follow-up on cooperation with other projects, track events connected 
with relevant stakeholders and international forums. 
Project Executive Committee (PEC): the PEC is the project’s driving force for project activities. It is chaired 
by the PC, reports to the GEA and is composed of WPL. WP Team members, QM, IM and the Quality Experts 
will be invited, in case their expertise is required. The PEC oversees project progress and in particular: 
• Implementation of all action plans. 
• Coordination of work package dependencies. 
• Maintaining communication and ensuring reporting.

• Providing guidance on Intellectual Property issues. 
• Supporting implementation of the quality assurance system. 
• Ensuring guidance on ethical and (legal) data protection issues is followed. 
• Creation of efficient team structures. 
• Establishing flexible effective communication and an appropriate meeting schedule. 
The Quality Manager (QM) is responsible for the definition of the Quality Assurance Plan ant its implementation 
by all partners. The QM will manage and coordinate the procedures to assess the quality of project deliverables 
and learning content for the short-term training programmes, appointing peer reviewers from the partners’ staff 
to support the process. 
Work Package Leaders (WPL). Work Package Leaders are responsible for managing their WP as a self- 
contained entity, as well as managing interfaces to other WPs through the PEC. WPL coordinate, monitor, and 
assess the progress of the WP to ensure that output performance, budget, and timelines are met. Their 
responsibilities include: 
• Production of project deliverables according to defined quality processes. 
• Identifying risks to report to the Project Manager and complying with risk mitigation plans. 
• Reporting quality issues and status to the Quality Manager. 
• Achievement of the technical objectives of the project in their domain. 
• Ensuring conformance of WP results with requirements of succeeding work packages 
Task Leaders (TL). Task leaders are responsible for managing their tasks as a self-contained entity, and in 
relation to other tasks part of the Work Package and of the project. Their responsibility include: 
• Plan and deploy the activities related to the task in accordance with the project timeline. 
• Contribute to the deliverables connected to their tasks. 
• Identify and flag to the WPL any task related risks while proposing mitigation actions. 
Project Communication Officer (PCO) will manage and coordinate all dissemination and outreach activities 
within SPECTRO project. The PCO will act as the single point of contact for partners for communication-related 
topics and will lead the communication and update meetings with partners to align on dissemination activities. 
Quality assurance, monitoring and evaluation strategy 
With regards to quality assurance and monitoring, the Quality Manager (QM) will be responsible for 
establishment and guiding implementation of quality assurance procedures. Quality processes include the timely 
completion and review of all technical achievements (deliverables, milestones) compared to the original time 
plan, as described in the Grant Agreement contract, and learning content for the education programmes. 
The QM will ensure that the periodic activity, deliverable, management and final project reports are completed 
and of high quality in accordance with the work plan. Additionally, the QM will keep the PEC informed on the 
status of all active quality processes and raise any issues requiring remedial action. As required, the QM takes 
part in PEC meetings as required and reports directly to the GEA. 
Additionally, the QM will ensure that the learning content used by the training providers is of high quality. The 
QM will keep the relevant WP Leaders and Task Leaders updated on the development status of the short-term 
training programmes from each training providers and raise any issues requiring urgent action. 
The definition of an effective quality monitoring system and mechanism will allow to monitor the phases of the 
project, to understand if the project is proceeding as planned and to anticipate problems instead of solving them 
afterwards. The quality control mechanism will overlook the project deliverables production and learning 
content production, relying on the expertise of the QM. 
The procedure that will be followed for the preparation of deliverables and production of the learning content will 
be agreed at the very beginning of the project. Before submission or publication, each project deliverable and 
learning content will be reviewed by the QM. When appropriate, the document/material will also undergo an 
English check by a native speaker. 
 
Cost effectiveness and financial management 
SPECTRO activities have been planned in detail, with the goal of obtaining the highest value for money. The 
Person Month (PM) allocation was agreed in a transparent manner in group meetings led by the Project 
Coordinator and attended by all SPECTRO partners, ensuring that the agreed budget allocation will provide 
enough resources to execute the project successfully. 

 
32 
 
The table below shows the distribution of PM per WP. WP1 and WP2 have the highest allocation of PM (33% 
each respectively) since they comprise the activities related to the design, delivery, and continuous monitoring 
and improvement of the education programmes in Cybersecurity and Robotics. The majority of PM in WP1 and 
WP2 is allocated to the higher education institutions, although all other partners will also have a smaller 
involvement in at least of the two WPs to participate to regular meetings with the higher education institutions, 
exchange best practices, align on the format, and plan the training programmes. In total, 50% of the budget will 
be spent on WP1 or WP2 as the main objective of the SPECTRO project, in line with the objective of Call 
DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03-SPECIALISED-EDU, is to design and deliver education programmes that will 
contribute to reduce the shortage of digital specialists in Europe. A high portion of budget (20%) will be used to 
support financially students attending SPECTRO programmes, this is budgeted under WP4. 
Among the other two WPs, WP4 requires the highest efforts in terms of PM (19%). This is it includes not only all 
the activities related to project management and operational/financial administration, but also the management, 
coordination and execution of the activities related to the enrolment of students and participants to the education 
programmes as well as the activities related to building a community and strong partnership mechanism that will 
sustain even after the end of SPECTRO project. 
WP3 will require a smaller effort than WP4 (14% of the total person months). This is because marketing and 
dissemination activities are required throughout the duration of the project to engage with relevant stakeholders 
and nurture leads. SPECTRO aims to attract as many participants as possible.

Outside resources (subcontracting, seconded staff, etc)   
As proved above, the SPECTRO consortium has all resources in-house, including the professional profiles 
expertise required to achieve the objectives of the project. Most staff to be appointed in the education 
programmes and other project activities is already available among the staff members employed at each partner 
with a few exceptions. In these cases, SPECTRO project will be used to attract high qualified teaching staff to 
contribute to the SPECTRO learning programmes. Thus, no seconded staff will be required during the four 
years of the project. 
The only resource that will be sought by SPECTRO partners will be a platform for implementing the exams 
required as part of the certification schemes that will be developed by SPECTRO partners. In this regard, an 
external provider will be subcontracted for an open-source, virtual environment platform for execution of the 
certification exams. The subcontracting will be carried out by EITD, following EITD’s best practices for sub-
contracting that are in line with EU values. Further details on the subcontracting are included in the dedicated 
table in Section 4. 
 
Consortium management and decision-making  
Decision processes: Decisions will be taken by the responsible team members, and organisation bodies based 
on the Description of Action (DoA) to be performed, as stated in the Grant Agreement, the Consortium Agreement, 
the DoA and the individual Work Package plans. In case there is a dispute between two or more team members, 
an agreement will be sought by informal communication. If no agreement is reached, the conflict resolution 
procedure will be resorted to. 
Management meetings: GEA and PEC will meet jointly at the beginning of the project for detailed strategy and 
planning. Thereafter, monthly PEC teleconferences (TCs) ensure a constant flow of information about progress 
and exchange on development and deployment issues. Formal GEA meetings for decision-making will occur at 
appropriate intervals, at least annually. PEC face-to-face meetings could happen every six months or upon 
request from the PC. Meetings with the EC, expert working groups and audit meetings will be scheduled and 
prepared as required. WPL will agree on meetings to deal with issues at the WP level, where possible, aligned 
with PEC meetings. Other project meetings will be aligned, e.g., workshops or key conferences in the field, to 
minimise the use of resources for such meetings. 
Conflict resolution: Agreement on any issue with divergent views usually is to be reached through informal 
contact. This is to be followed by confirmation via email or in agreed written minutes for substantial issues. In 
some cases, the agreement may take the form of a short statement or report signed by those responsible. 
Technical issues/conflicts within given contractual commitments that do not involve a change of contract, a change 

 
46 
 
of budget and/ or a change of resources/ overall focus will be discussed/ solved at the WP level first. Where a 
potential conflict is identified, the appropriate WPL will attempt to mediate between the parties. The PC must be 
informed if the solution affects the work plan and expected results or if no resolution is reached. In the latter case, 
the PC will make every effort to mediate, if necessary, involving other members of the PEC. Should the PEC not 
solve the conflict, the issue is referred to the GEA. The GEA will attempt to reach a unanimous decision in all 
cases. Should a consensus not be achieved, decisions will be reached by a simple majority vote, each delegate 
having one vote. Should a conflict not be resolved by this mechanism, the project coordinator will make a final 
decision on the matter after coordination with the EC PO. GEA delegates will ensure that decisions taken at the 
GEA are carried out by the participant they represent. 
Project communication and progress monitoring: WPL active work packages regularly report to the PEC. 
Reports make clear statements on work package progress, signal any potential threat to meeting objectives, 
and raise any resource issues from the point of view of work package objectives and deliverables. Minutes of 
PEC meetings are distributed to the PEC for approval without delay and distributed to GEA delegates. The 
progress of the project in terms of achieving objectives and resource consumption at the participant level is 
constantly monitored by the PC, assisted by the PM. Electronic mail is the standard means of communication, 
including alerts and results delivery. Documents may be exchanged by email or placed in the common shared 
repository in the agreed location. 
Innovation Management: Throughout the project, a core focus in management processes will be on developing 
both innovative methods of policy formulation and project organisation. This will be achieved primarily by 
maximising existing internal opportunities and synthesising the collective experience, knowledge, and creative 
energies of project partners. This involves moving away from existing management solutions and arriving at new 
concepts, which will enable all stakeholders to cooperate with a common and coherent understanding of the 
project’s goals and processes. Furthermore, it entails the creative collaboration of stakeholders at every stage, 
from the initial idea generation to the final execution of strategies. On the content side, the innovation management 
process will be supported by the QE in an advisory position to the PEC. 
Management of data. The Consortium lead partner, EITD, has implemented and adapted all its operations 
according to EU Regulation 2016/679 and ensures that these measures are kept consistent with all activities 
carried out. In line with the legal framework applicable and the eventually granted contract of services, a first 
internal assessment of personal data is always conducted with the consortium partners. If personal data 
processing is required, further arrangements are made with the relevant stakeholders. The project consortium 
will adhere to international standards and recommendations regarding the data formats, structure, and syntax 
of the data, like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Qualified partners are responsible for the 
implementation of the data management plan. Concerning data security and privacy issues, the data 
management plan will consider the EU directives related to both users’ rights relating to electronic 
communications networks and services, the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the 
electronic communications sector. The key EU directives are the 2002/58/EC, otherwise known as the ePrivacy 
Directive (ePD), and the (EU) 2016/679, also known as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Any 
change in the legislation will influence the ongoing project, regardless of the date of the legislation compared 
with the starting date of the research. 
Quality Assurance (QA): The project deliverables are a central focus of quality assurance and control within 
the project. The Quality Manager is accountable to the GEA and works closely with the PC and PEC, responsible 
for the adherence to agreed QA procedures. The generation of deliverables to specification and schedule is the 
responsibility of each WP Leader. Deliverables are subject to review and acceptance by the consortium and the 
EC. The quality assurance process for deliverables is executed through peer review and approval at the project 
level. Within or external to the project, two peer reviewers are appointed by the Quality Manager to review key 
deliverables. All partners provide experts to support the peer-review process. On receipt of the deliverable, the 
peer reviewers review and check the document for the overall quality of contents, presentation, 
comprehensiveness, etc. and its adherence to the requirements stipulated in the Grant Agreement. The formal 
approval of the deliverable by the Consortium is documented at a GEA meeting. 
3. IMPACT 
3.1 
Expected outcomes and deliverables – Dissemination and communication 
Expected outcomes and deliverables 
SPECTRO will deliver education programmes in two strategic digital technologies for Europe: 1) 
Cybersecurity, and 2) Robotics. The education programmes will meet the needs of the labour markets and will 
increase the number of citizens in Europe able to design, develop, and deploy digital solutions in the economy 
and across sectors. SPECTRO will contribute to reduce the existing gap in advanced digital skills in Europe, 

 
47 
 
focusing on the whole Europe but with expected higher contributions in seven countries (Finland, France, Italy, 
Hungary, the Netherlands, Romania, and Sweden). 
The SPECTRO pathway towards impact is rooted, in the first place, in generating direct benefits to a target 
group of beneficiaries, to whom the project offers a clear and sound value proposition. This target group 
includes not only individuals holding a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or related field across the whole 
Europe (including EU associated countries), but also working professionals (including working professionals 
from SMEs) and job seekers with previous work experience or relevant education background who are looking 
to improve their skills and competences in Cybersecurity or Robotics to meet employers’ needs. The 
successful participation of the target group in the planned education programmes (either two-year Master’s 
programmes or self-standing learning modules leading to certifications) will unlock the achievement of the four 
Specific Objectives, the expected outcomes, and consequently a number of logical steps towards the 
achievement of future impacts. 
Overall, SPECTRO will trigger widespread impacts which will consistently contribute to pursue the expected 
outcomes of the Call DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03-SPECIALISED-EDU-Specialised education programmes or 
modules in key capacity areas. The following table provides an overview of the expected relevance and scale 
of such impacts. The table provides both qualitative descriptions of the impacts and quantitative estimates of 
their reach and scale, including references to related project key performance indicators (KPIs).

WP1 and WP2 will contribute to this expected outcome and to the achievement of SO1 
– Addressing skill needs by delivering education programmes in Cybersecurity and 
Robotics. Mapping of the labour market needs, and workshops involving all SPECTRO 
partners will ensure alignment, especially at national level, between the needs of the 
labour markets and the curricula and format of the education programmes. SPECTRO 
achievements in relation to the development and delivery of education programmes 
will be summarised in six deliverables (D1.1, D1.2, D1.3, D2.1, D2.2, D2.3). The impact 
of SPECTRO programmes will be measured via the following KPIs: 
• KPI1: Number of developed master’s programmes on Cybersecurity: 1 
• KPI2: Number of developed master’s programmes on Robotics: 1 
• KPI3: Number of delivered full cycles of the master’s on Cybersecurity: 2 
• KPI4: Number of delivered full cycles of the master’s on Robotics: 2 
• KPI5: Number of developed and delivered self-standing modules on 
Cybersecurity or Robotics: 21 
• KPI6: Number of developed and delivered self-standing modules on Innovation 
and Entrepreneurship or Ethics: 4 
• KPI7: Number of implemented certifications schemes for the self-standing 
modules: 4 
• KPI8: Number of higher education institutions in the consortium offering the 
education programmes on Cybersecurity: 7 
• KPI9: Number of higher education institutions in the consortium offering the 
education programmes on Robotics: 8

citizens who will be 
able to design, 
deploy, and use 
digital solutions 
involving 
Cybersecurity or 
Robotics technology. 
The expected outcome will be achieved through the education programmes delivered 
as part of WP1 and WP2, including two double-degree master’s programmes (120 
ECTS) and self-standing modules leading to certifications in Cybersecurity or Robotics. 
Relevance and appropriate target addressing labour market needs will be ensured by 
the activities carried out in WP1 and WP2. Promotion, marketing, and dissemination 
activities in WP3 will facilitate reaching the target audience, overall contributing to train 
more than the minimum requirement of 150 EU students/year in the two full cycles of 
education programmes. Dedicated marketing campaigns will be launched to promote 
diversity, including participation of women and people from RIS countries (see Section 
4, WP3 description). Every year, the results in terms of participation to the training 
programmes will be summarised in the annual deliverables D4.4, D4.5, D4.6, D4.7. 
The following KPIs will be used to measure the outcomes of the project: 
• KPI10: Number of people enrolled to the education programmes: 1400 
• KPI11: Number of EU citizens who received a double degree after the 
successful completion of a master’s programme: 200 

 
48 
 
• KPI12: Number of EU citizens who received a certificate of participation after 
the successful completion of a self-standing module: 800 
• KPI13: Number of people who received a certification after the successful 
completion of a specific sets of modules: 250 
Definition and 
implementation of a 
scholarship 
programme 
promoting diversity 
and supporting 
students to 
participate to the 
education 
programmes  
 
In line with SO4, WP4 will define a comprehensive scholarship programme to ensure 
that financial support will be provided to students to participate to the master’s 
programmes offered by SPECTRO. The scholarship programme will include 
scholarships dedicated to increasing the participation of women and citizens from RIS 
countries, promoting diversity in terms of gender, age, social and economic 
background.  The scholarships will be defined in detail during the first year of the 
project. It will be detailed in deliverable D4.1. The results in terms of participants 
accepted to the scholarship programme will be summarised in the annual deliverables 
D4.4, D4.5, D4.6. The KPIs to monitor the performance of the scholarship programme 
will be: 
• KPI14: Number of EU citizens receiving financial support: 150 
• KPI15: Percentage of scholarship recipients from RIS countries: >40% 
• KPI16: Percentage of female scholarship recipients: >30% 
Establishment of 
structural and 
sustainable 
partnerships 
between consortium 
partners, allowing 
participants to the 
education 
programmes to 
benefit from 
capacities and 
specialisms of 
different partners in 
the consortium. 
 
This outcome, which is related to SO3, will be achieved through the development of 
effective education and training partnerships between the higher education institutions, 
research centre, and innovative businesses included in the SPECTRO consortium. The 
structure of the education programmes developed by SPECTRO partners as part of 
WP1 and WP2 will require a high degree of interaction between consortium members. 
Additional actions and instruments will be put in place in WP4 to foster and facilitate 
interaction and collaboration between SPECTRO partners and with industry partners 
outside of the consortium. These will include the development of an internship 
programme facilitating the participation of companies across Europe, especially SMEs, 
and the establishment of pools for exchanging guest lecturers and business mentors 
between partners. The implemented actions and their results will be summarised in 
D4.7 and D4.8. The KPIs to monitor the effectiveness of the partnerships will be: 
• KPI17: Number of collaborations with industry players, including businesses 
outside of the consortium: 150 
• KPI18: Number of guest lectures/seminars in the education programmes held 
by experts from the SMEs and research centre in the consortium: 80 
• KPI19: Number of internships carried out by students: 200, of which 20 
completed at organisations member of the consortium 
Adequate promotion 
of the portfolio of 
education 
programmes to 
attract the interest of 
participants, 
including listing and 
promotion of the 
courses on the 
Digital Skills and 
Jobs Platform. 
WP3 will include a full range of activities in marketing and promotion, aimed at 
engaging with relevant stakeholders for promotion purposes and ensuring participation 
from all over Europe. These activities will contribute to the achievement of SO2 and 
will also support a structure that will stay in place to coordinate training implementation 
beyond the project closure. A marketing and dissemination plan will be put in place in 
the first months of the project (D.3.1). The activities implemented afterwards throughout 
the duration of the project will be summarised in four annual deliverables (D.3.2, D3.3, 
D3.4). The effectiveness and completion of such activities will be measured by the 
following KPIs: 
• KPI20: Number of applications to the education programmes: 3500 
• KPI21: Number of master’s programmes on Cybersecurity and Robotics listed 
on the Digital Skills and Jobs Platform: 2 
Successful 
implementation of 
dissemination and 
outreach activities to 
engage with the 
target stakeholders 
As part of WP3, SPECTRO workplan includes activities in the area communication and 
dissemination to increase awareness about the education programmes and engage 
with relevant stakeholders. The results of these activities will be reported in D.3.1, D3.2, 
D3.3. Successful implementation of dissemination and outreach activities will be 
measured by the number of leads generated. Additionally, a set of KPIs will be put in 
place to monitor the outreach of SPECTRO communication and dissemination 
activities (see Table 5). 
• KPI22: Number of leads interested in the education programmes: 12,000 
 

 
49 
 
Dissemination and communication 
Dissemination and communication plan 
Communication and dissemination activities are key to the success of the project and achievement of SO2. 
Both provide value to the stakeholders and contribute to achieving the desired impact of the project. Hence, 
the SPECTRO consortium will establish strong communication links with, and build on, the relevant research 
and innovation activities of H2020, Horizon Europe, and other EU, national and international programmes 
targeting the Digital Education Plan. 
The communication and dissemination activities of the project, led by EITD under T3.2, aim at ensuring the 
project results and outputs reach the relevant target audiences as widely as possible by selecting the 
appropriate channels and tools and developing engaging promotional campaigns that will be timely 
implemented. 
To this end, an overarching marketing plan will further define the communication and dissemination objectives 
(see below). It will set the direction for the communication campaign by giving a recognisable, unique, strong 
voice to SPECTRO and defining a strategy for EU-wide outreach. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will help 
gauge the project communications’ impact and inform the periodical consolidation of the communication plan. 
The communication and dissemination strategy will be translated into a set of dissemination actions and 
promotional campaigns and implemented via the project communication channels and those of partners to 
maximise impact. Below we present the Dissemination Objectives (DO). 
• DO1. Raise awareness. Ensure that the key results are disseminated (spread and understood) among 
the target audiences of the project 
• DO2. Engage key stakeholders. Maintain the engagement of the involved stakeholders across related 
projects and further engage other actors vital to or benefiting the outreach. 
• DO3. Enhance sustainability long-term. Maintain effective collaboration of key stakeholders during and 
beyond after the project lifetime. Develop an appropriate structure to coordinate the training 
implementation beyond the project closure. 
Dissemination campaigns will aim to reach out to established target groups at the local, regional, national, and 
European level. The main target groups are: 1) Research and Innovation centres (Incubators, accelerators, 
research staff members, for example European Innovation Council, European Digital Innovation Hubs), 2) 
Industry players (SMEs start-ups, scale-ups, business associations and clusters (e.g., Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry, National clusters of companies), 3) Civil society organisations and professional 
associations (representing members, and employees in the key focus areas of the project), 4) Education 
and training providers (higher education institutions, public/private training organisations), 5) 
Public/government bodies and initiatives (policymakers and decision-makers in strategic areas such as 
employment, education, 
digitisation, e.g. DG CNECT, DG EAC, JRC, EMPL, Ministers of Education). Communication tools and 
channels 
The dissemination plan will follow a multi-channel strategy. The following list gives an overview of the planned 
channels (CH). These will explain how the target groups are to be reached, along with other relevant SME 
stakeholders, policymakers, and general public. Table 5 summarises the target KPIs in each channel. 
CH1. SPECTRO webpage. The cornerstone of the online communication strategy will be the SPECTRO 
webpage, a portal stored at the EIT Digital webpage (https://www.eitdigital.eu/). It will be accessible to all 
engaged partners and external stakeholders providing up-to-date information about SPECTRO (e.g., news 
articles, press releases, resources). In addition, it will promote the project milestones, outputs, results, and 
events, and thus deliver value- added content. It will also serve as a registration portal for all SPECTRO 
programmes. Keywords and Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) will be carefully considered when setting it up 
to make it as as relevant and visible as possible, in an organic way. 
CH2. Social media. Organic promotion on social media will help extend the reach of key dissemination and 
communication messages to wider geographical audiences, providing an excellent opportunity for better 
outreach. Social media channels are key great amplifiers where the target SPECTRO groups may be highly 
active. Partners will use their respective communication channels to pass on the key messages and maximise 
impact. Hashtags will be used to highlight keywords and attract relevant audiences. One project hashtag will 
be established to accompany all social media messages launched by the project (e.g., #SPECTRO). 
CH3. Paid advertisement on social media. Paid promotional content for the project channels will be 
conducted to grow a community of stakeholders and ambassadors at key moments such as the launch of the 
website in M3. 

 
50 
 
CH4. Paid Search Advertisement on Google. Paid search engine promotional and display ads for the project 
will be conducted on Google aiming to create high visibility for the project and to exponentially grow the 
audience. 
CH5. Event, conferences, meetings. To ensure the effective dissemination of project results, the consortium 
will be present at the main national and European events related to the Digital Education Action Plan and 
tertiary educational ICT programmes, by actively participating through presentations or the organisation of 
specific sessions. Partners will seek to organise and/or participate in third-party topical events and EU-wide 
conferences to present the project and consolidate links with related initiatives and market players. A mapping 
of upcoming event opportunities will be developed and updated regularly with the support of partners. 
CH6. Scouting and synergies with other related initiatives and projects. One key element to the success 
of project is to cooperate with well-established related initiatives, projects, and networks that have the power 
and influence to give a boost to the project visibility (e.g., Digital Innovation Hubs, Digital Transformation 
Accelerator, Enterprise Europe Network, European SME Alliance, WEgate). To this end, a stakeholder 
mapping, managed by project coordinator EITD, will be created and populated by the project partners. EITD will 
lead the outreach actions toward the identified key stakeholders and promote the project with the aim to create 
new cross-dissemination opportunities and strengthen cooperation. 
CH7. Dissemination materials. Marketing material will serve to present the consortium activities and 
objectives with one common approach, both in terms of visuals and through narrative. This will enable all 
members of the consortium to participate in public events and to create and strengthen the sensemaking and 
the idea of one unique brand. Different sets will be produced (in English) together with visuals such as an 
online brochure on the project, PowerPoint template and official presentation of the project, roll-up banner, a 
word deliverable template, and other online banners. Partners will be invited to localise key materials. All the 
assets produced will be aligned with the visual identity of the project and include both the project logo and EU 
emblem. 
Visibility of EU funding: All the project deliverables and templates (printed or electronic) will include the EU 
emblem, acknowledging the funding from the European Union, and, when appropriate, the relevant disclaimer. 
The main online communication tool - the SPECTRO website - will feature the EU emblem and type of funding 
received in its footer, ensuring it is visible on all pages, together with all the project partner’s logos.

Competitiveness and benefits for society 
Competitiveness and benefits for society 
EU countries are facing a significant gap between the availability and demand of ICT specialists. A crucial 
issue to address to reduce this gap is the modernisation of education and training systems, which currently do 
not prepare people sufficiently for the digital economy and society. This also includes a move to a life-long 
learning approach to improve people’ digital skills set at any stage of life to adapt to the ever-digitalising world. 

 
51 
 
There are fundamental digital strategic sectors where Europe heavily relies on its global competitors, such as 
in the domain of semiconductors and online platforms, and cloud computing. SPECTRO will contribute to 
levelling the playing field between Europe and technology leaders such as China and the US by training 
specialists and by upskilling the current workforce in strategic digital technologies for Europe. 
The European Commission, through the Digital Compass, recognises that Europe will only achieve digital 
leadership by building it on a sustainable digital infrastructure regarding connectivity, microelectronics, and 
the ability to process vast data, as they act as enablers for other technological developments and support the 
industry's competitive edge. Increasing the number of specialists in digital technologies is crucial since Europe 
can only build this sustainable digital infrastructure if it has the labour force with the expertise to do so. 
Furthermore, while building competitiveness is important, we will ensure that our project does this while 
maintaining the European approach of value and human rights, focussing also on ethics and privacy. 
SPECTRO will provide training to EU citizens in key activity areas such as Cybersecurity and Robotics. 
Robotics will have several impacts on our future society. Understanding how Robotics can support businesses 
will allow Europe to become more competitive. Appropriate use of Robotics in combination with Artificial 
Intelligence will also support the Green Deal goals, both with efficiencies and with better cooperation that 
reduces environmental impact. Europe could prove itself to be a global leader in the uptake and development 
of green digital technologies. 
Cybersecurity is a topic that is having increased relevance in the political-economic landscape. This is due to 
the strong influence of technologies in our society and in our modus vivendi. The ever-wider use of new 
technologies, the digitisation of all processes, the establishment of factual information assets has increasingly 
highlighted the issue of Cybersecurity. Our "always connected" life has not only advantages but also many 
risks. Risks that become greater in the case of large structures and companies, from hospitals to banks. Data 
transmission puts IT security at risk, producing worldwide risks in the event of attacks and thus jeopardizing 
the cyber security, the IT security of the most important systems. Education specialists in Cybersecurity is 
strategic for Europe to o prevent and react to what will be the frailties of the future. Furthermore, it will allow to 
lay the foundations for new lasting and resilient job opportunities in Europe.

Figure 5. SPECTRO work plan. 
The SPECTRO project is organised in 4 different work packages. Figure 6 shows the connections and 
relationships between the work packages. To provide a brief overview of the relationship between the work 
packages, one can start with WP1 – Education programmes in Cybersecurity and WP1 – Education programmes 
in Robotics, which represent the core of the project, focusing on the build-up and deployment of all training 
activities in Cybersecurity and Robotics. WP1 and WP2 are interconnected with WP3 – Marketing and 
dissemination activities, as alignment between WP1 and WP2 with WP3 activities is needed for several reasons. 
For example, dedicated promotion activities will be required to promote WP1 and WP2 education programmes.

Financial support to 
third parties 
Financial support provided to the students enrolled to the two master’s 
programmes delivered by SPECTRO partners. This budget includes the cost 
for full tuition fee waivers, half tuition fee waivers, and scholarships of 
excellence (full tuition fee waivers + monthly allowance) provided to students 
enrolled to one of the two full cycles of the two master’s programme delivered 
within the 48 months of this project. The enrolment process is controlled by 
EITD, and implemented by EITDEF which will hold the whole scholarship 
budget. The financial support is given to students to cover i) the costs of the 
tuition fees at the higher education institutions, and ii) in form of monthly living 
allowances (to the recipients of the scholarships of excellence). 
 
The financial contribution to third parties will consist of scholarships provided 
to students for their participation to the master program organized and 
executed in WP1. 
There will be three possible kinds of scholarship provided by the project, all 
significantly under the threshold of 60,000 EUR: 
• 
full tuition fee waivers (the scholarship will cover all tuition fees for 
the student) 
• 
half tuition fee waivers (the scholarship will cover 50% of the tuition 
fees for the student), and 
• 
scholarships of excellence (consisting of full tuition fee waivers and 
a monthly allowance paid to the student: ~800€/month, adapted by a 
coefficient adapted to the host country life-cost, for the duration of 
the master) 
The actual number of scholarships of the three kinds will be agreed within the 
project consortium, considering the number of subscription requests received 
by the different partner universities. To achieve the defined project KPI, the 
project expects to provide scholarship to at least 200 students in total (100 
students per project cycle). These scholarships will be publicly announced 
during the master promotion and in the recruitment cycles on all the 
participant’s website and on the Funding & Tender Portal. The call will remain 
open during the whole recruitment cycle and, at the end of it, a review process 
will take place to assign the scholarships. Scholarships will be awarded on 
merit, with the selection process involving a comprehensive assessment of 
candidates’ academic records and relevant prior experiences, enabling the 
identification of the most distinguished students. The allocation of 
scholarships will then be done just before sending the letter of acceptance. 
EITD is going to centralize the management of this support but will provide 
1,850,000 

 
55 
 
evidence of the process of selection applied to scholarship attribution to the 
other participants = 200 students * 7.800€ average financial support ~ 
1.560.000€. 
 
This budget also includes the coverage of costs for students’ participation to 
the kick-off and the graduation ceremonies that will take place at the 
beginning and at the end of each academic year of the program. These 
events will constitute fundamental steps for the minor specialty in Innovation 
and Entrepreneurship being the only moments (together with the summer 
course) where all students will be gathered and will have the possibility to 
work in a collaborative way on their business case. For these events, this 
budget will support travel and accommodation expenses for the students 
(around 100 per event) to join the meeting venue and participate to the 
collaborative activities. = 2 cycles * 2 meetings * 100 students * 725€ for travel 
and accommodation ~ 290 000€

1 See Article 6 for the eligibility conditions. All amounts must be expressed in EUR (see Article 21 for the conversion rules).
2 The consortium remains free to decide on a different internal distribution of the EU funding (via the consortium agreement; see Article 7).
3 Indirect costs already covered by an operating grant (received under any EU funding programme) are ineligible (see Article 6.3). Therefore, a beneficiary/affiliated entity that receives an operating grant during the action duration cannot declare indirect costs for the year(s)/reporting period(s) covered by the operating grant, unless they can
demonstrate that the operating grant does not cover any costs of the action. This requires specific accounting tools. Please immediately contact us via the EU Funding & Tenders Portal for details.
4 See Data Sheet for the funding rate(s).
5 This is the theoretical amount of the EU contribution to costs, if the reimbursement rate is applied to all the budgeted costs. This theoretical amount is then capped by the 'maximum grant amount'.
6 The 'maximum grant amount' is the maximum grant amount decided by the EU. It normally corresponds to the requested grant, but may be lower.
7 See Annex 2a 'Additional information on the estimated budget' for the details (units, cost per unit).

1.  General data
Project summary:
Project summary
SPecialised Education programmes in CybersecuriTy and Robotics (SPECTRO) will focus on the design and delivery of two double-
degree master’s programmes (ISCED Level 7, 120 ECTS) in two key digital technology areas for the future of Europe: 1) Cybersecurity
and 2) Robotics. The two specialised master’s programmes, which will also include a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, will be
designed and delivered by a consortium consisting of 12 higher education institutions from 7 different countries, 2 innovative SMEs, 1
leading research centre in Information Systems and EIT Digital, a pan-European organisation with in-depth knowledge and experience
in the digital skills domain. The master’s programmes developed by SPECTRO partners will address the labour market needs, foster
strong interactions and mobility between academia and business, strengthen knowledge triangle integration, promote entrepreneurship,
and considerably boost the growth of the existing EIT Digital ecosystem, one of the largest digital ecosystems in Europe. In addition to
the two master’s programme, SPECTRO partners will also develop and deploy a series of self-standing learning modules on topics related
to Cybersecurity and Robotics. These modules will lead to four different certifications, which will be released by participating higher
education institutions and EIT Digital. Dedicated marketing, promotion, communication, and dissemination activities will be carried out
by SPECTRO partners to maximise the outreach of project activities and to attract the desired target audience to the master’s programmes
and self-standing modules. SPECTRO will expand the specialised education offer in Europe and will contribute to reducing the current
shortage of digital specialists in Europe, by providing training to more than 1000 European citizens in Cybersecurity and Robotics.
